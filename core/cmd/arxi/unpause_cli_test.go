// These run the real binary because the point of every one of them is what the
// BINARY did. The three defects this file exists to pin were all found by
// walking the command by hand, and none would have shown up in a unit test of
// the functions involved:
//
//   - two lines of one command disagreed about the same ceiling (0.0050 vs 0.01)
//   - `run start` did the same thing in its own banner, rounding a ceiling UP
//   - a failed run left writer.lock behind, so the NEXT command refused
//
// The last is the one a unit test could not have reached at all: it is a
// property of os.Exit skipping deferred calls, which only exists in a real
// process.

// budgetBlockedRun starts a simulated run that genuinely runs out of budget,
// and returns its id.
//
// It is not a hand-written log, unlike blockedRun in inbox_cli_test.go, and the
// difference is deliberate. A hand-written log states what I believe a budget
// block looks like; this one is whatever the reducer actually produces, so a
// change in how blocks are recorded is caught here instead of being encoded
