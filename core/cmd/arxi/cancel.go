// `arxi run cancel <run> [--reason <why>]` -- end a run for good, and say what
// that costs.
//
// # The same one append as pause, and a very different act
//
// Mechanically this is `run pause` again: `case RunCancelled` sets Status and
// returns no effects (internal/kernel/decide.go:59), so there is no loop to
// drive and the command is finished when the byte lands. Everything that makes
// it a different command is in what the status MEANS.
//
// StatusCancelled is terminal (internal/kernel/state.go:29), and terminal is
// enforced at the top of the reducer: an event arriving at a terminal run is
// folded into nothing (decide.go:32). So this append does not stop the run the
// way a pause does -- it makes every later event in this log inert. There is no
// `run uncancel` in the surface and there should not be one: the log is
// append-only, and a status that could be taken back would not be terminal.
//
// # Why --reason is optional in the surface and asked for here
//
// docs/design/20-use-cases.md:407 is explicit: the reason "lands in the log, so
// `run list` six weeks later distinguishes a run that was abandoned from one that
// failed. Both look identical without it." The surface declares it optional, so
// this command cannot require it -- but it can say, once, at the moment it is
// still possible to supply, that the log cannot be edited afterwards.
//
// The payload key is `reason`, which is not this command's invention twice over:
// spec/events.md:41 declares `run.cancelled` with `reason?`, and
// cancelReason (runresult.go:261) already reads that key. Writing anything else
// would produce a cancelled run whose `run result` has nothing to show.
