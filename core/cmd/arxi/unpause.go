// cmdRunUnpause implements `arxi run unpause <run> [--budget N]`.
//
// # This is the command the rest of the tool has been recommending
//
// `run why` prints "arxi run unpause <run>" for a paused run and
// "arxi run unpause <run> --budget <higher>" for an exhausted budget;
// spec/events.md lists the second as THE remedy for a budget block; §20.6
// builds its whole narrative on it. Until now the binary answered "declared but
// not implemented" to both. A remedy a document names and the binary refuses is
// the worst kind of gap, because it is found by the person already in trouble.
//
// # Resuming is appending, and then driving
//
// The command does two things, and the split matters. First it appends
// run.unpaused -- that is the whole of the state change, and the reducer decides
// what it means (status back to running, parked causes handed back, a raised
// ceiling honoured). Second it drives the loop, because an event in a log moves
// nothing on its own: something has to fold it and carry out the effects.
//
// `arxi inbox` deliberately does only the first half and says so ("the run
// resumes when it is next driven"), because answering a question is not the same
// act as paying for the turns the answer unblocks. Unpause is the other half,
// and it is where "resume this run" becomes a thing a person can actually do.
//
// # THE CURSOR PROBLEM, and its durable answer
//
// A continuation must know which source event's effects were committed. The
// event-log tip cannot answer that: progress records and domain outcomes may sit
// above an unfinished source event. Restarting from zero is worse because it can
// repeat paid work. Modern runs therefore commit exec.step_completed and derive
// the cursor from the greatest validated source-event frontier. A run without
// those records remains inspectable but is refused before any continuation event
// is appended; guessing would turn recovery into either omission or duplicate
// external work.
