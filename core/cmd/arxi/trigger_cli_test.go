// The trigger CLI, exercised as a process.
//
// # Why a second test file, and why it costs a build
//
// trigger_test.go tests the parts that return: parseInvocation, the column
// functions, the JSON projection. It cannot test the rest, because the rest
// calls os.Exit — and os.Exit in an in-process test kills the test binary, so
// there is no way to assert on what happened. Four mutations survived the
// in-process suite for exactly that reason and for no other: the code they
// changed was only reachable through a path that exits.
//
// Two of those four were real. `trigger delete` answering with a plain "unknown
// subcommand" instead of the pause explanation, and the list table reverting to
// fixed-width columns, both left the suite green. A third — an impossible
// schedule reported as an operational failure rather than misuse — looked
// unobservable until the thing it changes was named: the exit code. That is the
// distinction a CI job acts on, so it is worth a test.
//
// The price is a `go build` per run, paid once and cached in arxiBin. Spending
// it buys the only assertions that can exist about exit codes, about stderr on
// the failure paths, and about whether a refused create left anything behind.
//
// # The two mutations that are left, and why they are not gaps
//
// Recorded here so nobody re-derives it. 24 mutations of trigger.go, 19 caught,
// 2 not killable and 3 invalid:
//
//   - Removing `.UTC()` from the NEXT column changes nothing, because
//     Spec.Next normalises `now` to UTC on entry and builds its answer from
//     that, so the value is already UTC when it arrives. The call is a guard
//     against that upstream changing, and a guard whose invariant currently
//     holds elsewhere cannot be observed from here. Testing it would mean
//     asserting on a fact about internal/trigger from cmd/arxi, which is the
//     wrong package to state it in — internal/trigger already does.
//
//   - Deleting the declared-but-unbuilt fallback changes nothing, because all
//     four declared trigger subcommands are built, so the switch never reaches
//     its default with a declared name. The branch is unreachable TODAY and
//     load-bearing on the day a fifth is declared, which is precisely when it
//     stops being unreachable; TestADeclaredButUnbuiltSubcommandIsNotCalledUnknown
//     is the test that starts failing then. Deleting the guard to raise a
//     mutation score would trade a real future protection for a number.
//
// Three others were invalid, not survivors: one no longer matched the source
// and two did not compile. The harness compile-checks before running the tests
// for that reason — a mutation that fails to build is indistinguishable from
// one that was caught if the only thing read is an exit code.
