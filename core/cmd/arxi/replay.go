// cmdRunReplay implements `arxi run replay <run> [--until-seq N] [--json]`.
//
// # This is the verb the whole architecture was arranged for
//
// ADR-0001 claims Decide(State, Event, Config) -> (State', []Effect) is pure, and
// docs/design/20-use-cases.md:530 spends that claim: "replay is the fold with no
// executor. Same function as `run`, same code path -- not a reimplementation that
// drifts." Everything else in this package is a projection of a fold somebody
// else performed. This one performs the fold itself, with the executor simply
// absent, which is why it needs no new machinery at all: kernel.Decide, the
// frozen blueprint and the log were already enough.
//
// So the interesting engineering here is not the fold. It is refusing to lie
// about what the fold did, and there were two chances to.
//
// # §20.9's own transcript prints a wrong number, and this does not copy it
//
// The design doc shows:
//
//	state at seq 44: stage review, backend idle, frontend submitted
//	  spend: 0.0000 USD (replay does not execute effects)
//
// The parenthetical is right and the label is wrong. Two different amounts are
// in play at seq 44: what THIS PROCESS spent, which is exactly zero because it
// called nothing, and what the ORIGINAL RUN had spent by then, which is folded
// out of its llm.response events and is whatever it is. A run that burned $3.10
// by seq 44 replayed as "spend: 0.0000 USD" is the exact failure ADR-0002 warns
// about three paragraphs later -- "it would not error; it would just be
// confidently wrong, which is the failure mode a debugging tool can least
// afford" -- and it would be produced by the debugging tool itself.
//
// Both figures are printed, each labelled with whose it is. §20.9's parenthetical
// is kept verbatim on the zero, because that is the line it belongs to.
//
// # "No executor" is measured, not asserted
//
// The other chance to lie is subtler: the parenthetical asks the reader to take
// on faith that nothing was executed. The fold knows better than that. Every
// kernel.Decide call hands back the effects it wanted, and those are exactly the
// work an executor would have done -- so they are counted and the count is
// printed, split by whether the effect costs money (SpawnTurn and CallTool) or
// not. "12 skipped, 3 of them spend" is evidence; "replay does not execute
// effects" is a promise. The line costs one integer and turns one into the other.
//
// It also earns its place as a debugging figure in its own right. A replay whose
// tally is 40 turns is a run that asked for forty model calls to get where it
// got, and that number appears nowhere else in the tool.
//
// # Folded event by event, and not with kernel.Fold
//
// logstore.(*Store).Fold already does exactly this in three lines, and it is not
// used, for two reasons that are both about what it throws away. It returns the
// final state only, so the EVENT at the target seq -- which §20.9 puts on the
// headline, `stage.advanced build → review` -- is not recoverable from its
// result; and it discards the effects inside kernel.Fold, so the tally above
// cannot be taken. Both are available for free by running the same loop here.
//
// This is not a second reducer. The loop is `at, effs = kernel.Decide(at, e, cfg)`
// and nothing else; the ordering, the rules and the state transitions are the
// kernel's. Compare cmdRunFork, which folds event-by-event for the same class of
// reason (it needs the seq a run went terminal at) and is likewise not a fork of
// the reducer.
//
// # --until-seq is inclusive, and 0 is the same as absent
//
// Inclusive because `event log --since-seq` is (event.go:284), and the two flags
// would otherwise differ by one event in opposite directions on commands a user
// runs one after the other. Zero means the whole log for the same reason
// logstore.Read does (store.go:396) and parseSinceSeq does: a script computing
// `--until-seq $(...)` from an empty or fresh log passes 0, and treating that as
// "replay nothing" would answer a question nobody asked. A negative is refused
// rather than clamped -- it can only be a bug in whatever produced it.
//
// # It takes no lock and writes nothing
//
// Not even the snapshot. `run replay` is safe to run against a live run being
// appended to by another process, which is the case it is most wanted in, and the
// writer lock exists precisely to make that impossible. Nothing here needs
// atExit either: the reason that registry exists is os.Exit skipping the deferred
// release of a lock this command never takes.

// that submitted and then went to `tool` or `waiting` has Submitted true and a State
// that says otherwise -- decide.go:717 keeps a finished turn from overwriting the
// state precisely so that flag survives -- and a stage's advance rule is judged on
// Submitted, not on State. Printing only `waiting` for such a member invites the
// reader to ask why the stage has not advanced when it already has what it needs.
//
// It is NOT `run show`'s memberNote. That function answers "what is this member
// waiting for", which needs the run's status and the pending causes and takes four
// lines per member to say. This answers "where was this member at seq N", in a form
// that fits a dozen of them on one line.

// the reading -- they are caveats on how much to trust it. A script doing
// `arxi run replay r1 > state.txt` gets the state in the file and the caveat on the
// terminal, which is the split every other command in this binary uses.
//
// Both WARN and continue, where `run fork` refuses on the second of them. That is
// not inconsistency: forking an odd log creates a new run that inherits the oddity,
// and folding one only reads it. A user replaying a log that is missing its
// blueprint is very often a user replaying it BECAUSE the log is broken, and a
// debugging verb that refuses to look at the broken case is not a debugging verb.
