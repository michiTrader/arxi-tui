// `arxi run show`, exercised as a process.
//
// Every test here is a defect that existed. Both of the real ones were found by
// pointing the built binary at a run produced by `run start --sim` and reading
// the output, not by inspecting the code -- which compiled, read correctly, and
// was wrong about the two things a person consults this view to learn: whether
// work is about to happen, and how much has been spent.
//
// runAt (from runlist_cli_test.go) is reused rather than reimplemented. A
// second fixture builder would drift from the first, and the first thing to
// drift would be the roster, which is exactly what these tests read.

// showBlocked writes a run stopped by its budget, with work parked on a member.
//
// The shape is copied from a REAL run: `arxi run start feature-team.yaml
// --budget 0.001 --sim` produces a run that spent 0.02 against 0.001, blocked,
// with pending causes on the members who were mid-stage. Reproducing the shape
// by hand keeps the test independent of the executor while still describing a
// state the system genuinely reaches.
//
// llm.response is what carries cost, NOT budget.exceeded. Checked against the
// reducer rather than assumed: an earlier version of this fixture used
// budget.exceeded alone and produced a run that was blocked while having spent
// nothing, which would have made the overspend test below unable to fail.
