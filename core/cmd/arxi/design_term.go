// design_term.go is the two things `arxi design` needs from a tty that the
// standard library does not offer: raw mode, and the window size.
//
// Both are ioctls, and both are done through syscall rather than through
// golang.org/x/term because arxi has no dependencies and will not take one on for
// sixty lines. The two constants that differ between kernels are in
// design_term_linux.go and design_term_bsd.go, and that is the whole of the
// portability story.

// rawMode puts the terminal into the mode a full-screen program needs and returns
// the function that puts it back.
//
// Raw means three things here. The kernel stops assembling lines, so a key is
// readable when it is pressed rather than at the next return. It stops echoing,
// so what is typed does not appear over the frame. And it stops turning ctrl+c
// into a signal, so ctrl+c arrives as a key -- which lets the designer leave
// through the same path as every other exit, with the same restore and the same
// receipt, instead of being killed halfway through a screen.
//
// OPOST is deliberately left ON, which is not what raw mode usually means. It is
// the flag that turns a lone \n into a carriage return and a line feed, and no
// frame depends on it: draw writes \r\n itself, precisely so it does not have to.
// What does depend on it is everything this binary prints that is not a frame -- a
// panic traceback above all. With OPOST off a traceback comes out as a staircase
// walking off the right of the screen, unreadable at the one moment it is the only
// thing left to read.
//
// The error comes back untouched rather than being made into a message here,
// because the caller has a much better one: an ioctl that fails on stdin means
// stdin is not a terminal, and cmdDesign knows what to suggest doing instead.

// syscall declares Termios and not this, on every kernel arxi builds for -- the

//
// The errno comes back as an error and is never logged here. ENOTTY on stdin is
