// Tests for `arxi run prompt`, run as the binary.
//
// They run the real binary because every defect this file pins was found by
// typing the command and looking at what happened afterwards -- and in three of
// the four cases the command had already printed success by then. That is the
// shape worth stating plainly, because it is the same one the last two steps
// hit:
//
//	A command that reports what it INTENDED rather than what it DID cannot be
//	caught by reading its output. It has to be caught by reading the state.
//
// The four defects, all measured on real --sim runs:
//
//   - the prompt was appended and then silently discarded, because nothing
//     drove the run and an un-parked cause lives only in Decide's return value
//   - the closing line advised `run unpause`, which REFUSES a running run --
//     so the command written to close a printed-and-refused gap printed one
//   - a budget-blocked run was told "it opens a turn now" and parked instead
//   - a refused CAS exited while holding writer.lock, bricking the run for
//     every later command
//
// The first is the one that matters most, and it is the reason the guards below
// look at the log and the folded state rather than at the banner.

// promptableRun starts a simulated run that stops on its budget, and returns
// its id. The run is genuinely produced by the reducer rather than hand-written,
// so a change in how a stop is recorded is caught here instead of being encoded
// twice and agreeing with itself.
//
// It stops BLOCKED, which is the state most of these guards want: the refusals
// and the CAS do not care how the run stopped, and the parking guard needs a
// halted one specifically. The tests that need a live, quiescent run use
// quiescentRun instead.

// quiescentRun writes a run that is RUNNING, has budget left, and cannot move:
// one member submitted, the stage needs all of them, and nobody is working. It
// returns the run id.
//
// This one is hand-written, and the reason is that the reducer cannot be asked
// for it. Quiescence with headroom is precisely the state the running loop
// drives its way out of, so any run produced by `run start` has either finished
// or stopped on a ceiling by the time the command returns. The state exists in
// real logs -- it is the one `kernel.Explain` has a dedicated branch for, and
// the only one whose remedy is `run prompt` -- but it is reached by a log that
// stopped mid-flight, not by a run that ran to a standstill in one process.
//
// BOTH members are given a turn and both turns are closed, and that is the whole
// shape of the fixture rather than a detail of it. Entering a stage COMMISSIONS a
// turn for every non-advisory member (spawnFor sets Member.TurnOpen), and Busy()
// is true for as long as that flag is set -- so a log in which frontend never
// appears describes a member who is permanently mid-turn, and a run with a busy
// member is not quiescent. `run why` says so: "frontend has a turn opening that
// has not started yet". frontend finishes its turn WITHOUT submitting, which is
// the ordinary way this state is reached -- it had nothing to submit yet -- and
// leaves the stage's `all` rule unmet with nobody left working on it.
//
// Every line carries `actor`, because that is the only field the reducer reads:
// applyActivated, applyTurnDone and applyStageSubmitted all resolve their member
// with out.Member(e.Actor) and return silently when it is empty. A payload-only
// `{"agent":"backend"}` folds to nothing at all, so a fixture written that way
// describes a state it does not produce.
//
// simulated:true is on run.started deliberately. Without it the drive builds a
// LIVE executor, which on a machine with no configured model spawns the turn
// and produces nothing -- so the test would report "the prompt opened no turn"
// for a reason that has nothing to do with the prompt.
