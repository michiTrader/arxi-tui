// # The contract is which stream, which exit code, and what "" means
//
// The command prints one string, which makes it look like the least testable half
// of the store. It is the opposite, for `run result`'s reason: this value's normal
// destination is another command's argument --
//
//	arxi state set r2 upstream.contract "$(arxi state get r1 api.contract)"
//
// -- so three things no screenshot shows are the whole of it. A headline on stdout
// silently becomes part of the value. An explanation on stdout for a key that is
// NOT set becomes the value of a key that has none. And an exit code that cannot
// tell "not set yet" from "no such run" turns a polling loop into either a spin on
// a typo or a wait for a write that already happened.
//
// # "" is a value, and every negative assertion here turns on that
//
// spec/events.md gives the store no delete, on the grounds that "a key that
// vanished from the fold could not be told from a key nobody ever set", so
// emptying a key is how a member retracts one. That makes `if value == ""` the
// single most likely defect in this command: it would report a key somebody
// deliberately emptied as a key that was never written, and the caller would go
// looking for the member who owes them a write that has already been made.

// between the two halves, and two of the states below -- a key set by an agent, a
// key read out of a terminal run -- are ones `state set` will not produce at all,
// the second because it refuses a terminal run outright. The exception is the
// round trip at the bottom, which uses both commands deliberately and says why.

// stateSetLine is one state.set log line, with the payload encoded rather than
// pasted.
