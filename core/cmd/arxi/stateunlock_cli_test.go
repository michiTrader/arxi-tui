// `arxi state unlock`, exercised as a process against real run directories.
//
// The reducer's release arm is `releaseLock(&out, e.Str("key"))` and nothing
// more: it does not check the holder, deliberately, so that a key claimed by an
// agent that crashed mid-turn can be reclaimed at all. Every question about who
// is ENTITLED to release a lock is therefore answered here, in the CLI, and the
// answer is written into the log as a `reason`. That makes the defects worth
// guarding a different set from `state lock`'s:
//
//   - a release recorded under the wrong reason. The log is the only record of
//     whether a key was handed back, reclaimed from a lapsed lease or taken from
//     a holder still working, and `event log --type 'lock.*'` is where somebody
//     asks. A wrong reason there is not a stale display, it is a permanent
//     misstatement of what happened;
//   - `expired_at` on a forced release, which would record a lapse that nobody
//     judged and no clock supports -- the exact judgement --force exists to say
//     was not made;
//   - a refusal that still appends. A release the message said did not happen
//     frees the key in every later fold, which is worse than the collision the
//     lock exists to prevent, because the log then contradicts the terminal;
//   - the wrong exit code. 3 means "ask again later" across this binary, and
//     nothing here ever becomes possible by waiting;
//   - claiming the member waiting on the key is now free to move. It is not, and
//     that is the one thing this command must not imply.
//
// # Fixtures are shared with statelock_cli_test.go on purpose
//
// liveBackendLock, lapsedBackendLock and eternalBackendLock are the three shapes
// of somebody else's lock, and they are the same three this command arbitrates
// over -- one refused, one reclaimed, one forced. A private copy here would drift
// from the file that documents what each shape means.
//
// The clock is not pinned, for the reason that file gives: these tests exec the
// binary as a subprocess, so nothing in this process reaches nowFunc. An expiry in
// 2020 is lapsed at every real now and one in 2099 is live for longer than this
// code will run.

// ownLiveLock is a lock held by a shell, which is what "our own" means here.
//
// It carries `source: human` and NO actor, because that is how lockHolder reads a
// lock this binary took: Actor first, falling back to the source. Written by hand
// rather than by running `arxi state lock`, per emit_cli_test.go -- a fixture built
// with the code under test cannot distinguish a bug in the fixture from a bug in
// the thing being measured.
//
// The turn_done at seq 5 is the same one the three locks in statelock_cli_test.go
// carry, and for the reason given there: the acquire matches a lock.* watcher, so
// it commissions security's turn, and a fixture that leaves it open answers every
// release with "queued: security is mid-turn".

//
// The empty key is the worse half and is the reason this is a refusal rather than a
// trim: releaseLock drops a lock.released with no key, so the event would land in the
