// Command arxi is the binary.
//
// Today it implements schema, surface, why, design, blueprint validate,
// blueprint create, blueprint install, run start (live, calling real models, or
// --sim), run list, run show, run why, run tree, run prompt, run steer,
// run result, run pause, run unpause, run cancel, run fork, run replay,
// run attach, event emit, event log, event trace, state set, state get,
// state lock, state unlock, serve, the trigger group, the inbox group, the agent
// group, role define, the eval group (--sim only), provider add and the model
// group; for everything else it answers "declared but not implemented" with the
// exact name of the capability. It also answers `arxi -p "<prompt>"`, which is
// not a capability and is not counted as one: it is an alias over `run start`
// with the actor and the ceiling filled in, argued for at the top of ask.go.
// That is on purpose: the surface is frozen and verified by tests BEFORE the
// executor exists, so adding a new command is implementing something that was
// already promised, not inventing a new promise.
//
// The measured figure, rather than this list, is the one to trust. See the
// README, where a probe that walks the registry against the built binary
// produces it -- and where a test fails if the number written down disagrees
// with the binary. No count is repeated here on purpose: this comment has no
// such test, so a figure in it can only rot.
//
// This paragraph has already been wrong seven times. It claimed three commands
// after six existed, it said `run start` was --sim only after the live executor
// had landed, it carried "16 of 47" through six wirings and two registry
// corrections, it omitted `run prompt` for that verb's entire life -- found
// only when `run tree` was added to the same sentence -- it was silently
// missing `event emit`, the whole inbox group and `agent tool policy` until
// `run replay` landed and the coverage guard's own list of wired paths was read
// against it, and it went stale again one increment later: `state set` shipped
// wired, tested and counted in the README while this list did not mention it,
// found when `state get` was added to the same sentence. `design` then shipped
// the same way and was missing here for its whole life, found when the `-p`
// short form was added to the same sentence. That is the third omission caught
// by the act of editing the line for the NEXT verb, which is still the only
// mechanism that has ever caught one here.
//
// A doc comment that overstates what is missing is the kind of stale
// documentation that costs a reader nothing and a contributor everything: they
// reimplement what is already in the tree.
//
// Note that the measured figure did NOT move when the executor landed, because
// `run start` already counted as wired when only --sim worked. The number and
// this list answer different questions, which is why both are here: the count
// says how much of the surface is reachable, and this says what reaching it
// actually does.

  version                    version of the binary and of the surface

THE SHORT FORM
  arxi -p "ping"             ask the stored agent named default
  arxi -p "ping" -m <id>     ask with no stored agent at all; nothing is stored

  It is 'run start' with the actor and the spend ceiling filled in -- the same
  parser, the same loop, the same log -- so a flag that works there works here.
  stdout carries the reply and nothing else, which is what makes
  'arxi -p "..." > answer.txt' leave an answer in the file rather than a
  transcript; the ceiling, the spend and any trouble go to stderr. The ceiling
  is small, and it is printed with where it came from before the first model
  call is made: ARXI_BUDGET or --budget changes it, and nothing silences it.

SHORT FLAGS
  One letter means the same thing on every command that has that parameter:
  -b is --budget, -p is --prompt, -r is --run, -f is --path, -J is --json.
  A letter is an error on a command without that parameter, rather than being
  quietly ignored, because ignoring it discards the value and reports success.

  arxi surface --flags       the whole assignment, and what each letter reaches

Every capability 'arxi surface' declares is now wired to a command. This page is
the short list; 'arxi surface' is the whole one, and it names the protocol
message and the tool name for each. Something declared by a later surface version
and not built yet says so by name rather than calling itself unknown.

'run start' calls real models. It resolves each member's model against the
registered providers and charges --budget from the tokens they report, so a
first run wants 'provider add' before it. --sim drives the same reducer, log and
loop with no model calls, which is what makes a simulated log worth reading.
Tools and the inbox are still refused rather than faked, so a stage needing work
submitted goes quiet and names the member that owes it.

Its first argument is a blueprint file or the name of an agent from
'agent create'. A file that exists wins, so a stored agent can never shadow the
file you are editing; './name.yaml' says which one you meant either way.
