// `arxi -p "..."` -- the short way in.
//
// # Why this is not a new capability
//
// The surface declares 50 capabilities and the binary is measured against that
// count in three tests and three documents. A 51st verb added for convenience
// would turn all six red, and the honest fix would be to widen the frozen surface
// so a shortcut could exist. So this is a main.go-level alias, in the manner of
// `arxi why`: the flags are `run start`'s, expanded through `run start`'s own
// registry entry, parsed by `run start`'s own parser, and driven by the shared
// submission lifecycle. Nothing here is a second pipeline, so a flag added to
// arrives on this path already working.
//
// # Why it exists anyway
//
// Everything the binary could do was reachable only by naming an actor first. The
// first five minutes were: install, add a provider, write a YAML file, learn what
// a blueprint is, learn what a stage is, then get one answer. This path runs the
// stored agent named `default`, so the first five minutes are: install, add a
// provider, ask.
//
// # The one rule it bends, and how
//
// --budget is required on `run start` and has no default, because an invisible
// spend ceiling is a surprise bill. The objection there is to invisibility, not to
// defaults, so the ceiling is answered rather than dropped: every invocation
// prints the ceiling and where it came from before the first model call is made,
// and no flag on this path can silence that line.
//
// # Why stdout carries the reply alone
//
// `arxi -p "..." > answer.txt` should leave an answer in the file and not a
// transcript, so the ceiling, the spend and every complaint go to stderr. That is
// the visible difference from `run start`, which prints a summary table for
// somebody watching a terminal.
const (
	// The one stored name the short form looks for. It is an ordinary agent --
	// `arxi agent list` shows it, `arxi agent show default` prints it, the file is

	// guesses when nobody said one.
