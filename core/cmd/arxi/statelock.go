// `arxi state lock <run> <key> [--ttl <d>]` -- take a cooperative lock over the
// run's shared state.
//
// # What it buys
//
// docs/design/20-use-cases.md §20.8: two members told to work in parallel will
// both edit migrations/ unless something says who has it. The lock is that
// something. It is COOPERATIVE and not a filesystem lock -- it coordinates intent,
// and real isolation comes from the workspace -- so its whole value is that every
// reader of the fold agrees on one holder. That invariant is enforced in the
// reducer (acquireLock), not here.
//
// # The lease is the design, and it is why --ttl defaults
//
// §20.8 names the failure this command exists to avoid: "a lock with no expiry,
// held by an agent that crashed mid-turn, stalls the run until a human notices".
// The only lock.released this command writes is a steal of a lease that has run
// out, so a lock with no expiry is one no clock ever reclaims: it stands until
// somebody hands it back by name with `arxi state unlock`. A caller who says nothing
// therefore gets a lease, not eternity -- the reclaim that needs nobody's attention.
//
// # Refused with exit 3, so a script can wait
//
//	until arxi state lock r1 migrations/; do sleep 5; done
//
// terminates because a held key exits 3 and 1 stays reserved for "the run could
// not be read" -- the loop above would spin forever on a run id with a typo in it
// if the two shared a code. It is the same 3 as `run result`'s "not yet" and
// `state get`'s "not set", deliberately: one number means "ask again later"
// across the whole binary.

// disagree -- the day the reducer's fallback changes, this stops compiling instead

//
// The consequence worth stating out loud: two shells are ONE holder. The log
// cannot tell them apart, so a second `state lock` on a key this command already
