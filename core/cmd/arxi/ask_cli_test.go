// `arxi -p "..."`, exercised as a process.
//
// # Why this file exists next to ask_test.go
//
// The helpers next door are pure and tested as such. The one thing no unit test in
// this package can reach is the wiring: cmdAsk is called from a single `if` after
// main's dispatch switch, and looksLikeAsk answering "yes, a prompt" proves nothing
// about whether anybody asks it. That `if` is also the fragile part -- it lives
// after twenty cases, and moving it above them would turn `arxi --version` into a
// prompt with no prompt in it.
//
// # Why every run here is simulated
//
// The point of the path is to call a model, and a test suite must not. --sim leaves
// the model call itself untested and still proves the four things that break
// silently: the dispatch, the ceiling and where it was read from, which stream each
// line went to, and the exit code a pipe reads.
//
// arxiStreams and not arxi() for the reason runresult_cli_test.go gives: stdout
// belongs to the answer here, and a combined-output test cannot tell a diagnostic on
// stderr from the same sentence printed into the middle of somebody's answer file.

// The environment is set through t.Setenv rather than through a helper of its own,
// so the child inherits it and Go puts it back afterwards. Setting it to empty is
// deliberate in the tests that assert the built-in ceiling: a developer with
// ARXI_BUDGET exported in their own shell would otherwise change the number under
// test, or fail the suite outright with a value the binary is right to refuse.
