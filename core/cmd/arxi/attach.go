// `arxi run attach` follows a live run: the events that happen from now on.
//
// # What it is for
//
// docs/design/20-use-cases.md §20.1 shows it directly after `run show`, which
// reported `run r1: running (seq 12)`:
//
//	$ arxi run attach r1
//	[r1 seq 13] tool.call read src/auth.go
//	[r1 seq 14] llm.response 0.09 USD
//	[r1 seq 15] run.result
//
// Seq 13 is the first line. That is the whole specification of the join point and
// it is worth stating out loud: attach does NOT replay the twelve events that
// already exist. `event log` prints those, `run replay` folds them, `run show`
// summarises them. What none of them can do is tell you what happens next, and a
// verb that backfilled would answer a question already answered three times while
// making the interesting part scroll past.
//
// # Why this is the one verb that needed a machine that did not exist
//
// Every other run verb is a projection of a fold: read the log once, decide, print.
// This one reads a file another process is writing, so it needs three things the
// tree had no use for until now.
//
// FOLLOWING WITHOUT THE LOCK. logstore.Open takes the writer lock (ADR-0002, one
// writer per log) and truncates a rolled-back tail on the way in. A viewer that did
// that would refuse to attach to exactly the runs worth attaching to -- a live one
// is holding its lock -- and, worse, would be able to modify the log it is only
// meant to watch. So the log is opened as a plain file. The other readers in this
// tree already do this: `run show` and the inbox read events.ndjson directly and
// say why.
//
// A JOIN OFFSET THAT CANNOT SKIP AN EVENT. The obvious shape -- fold the run to
// learn where it is, then open the file and seek to the end -- loses every event
// appended between the two reads, silently, and only under load. So the fold and
// the follow share one read: readRunLog returns the bytes, the offset of the last
// newline in THOSE bytes is the join point, and the follow starts there. Whatever
// arrives in between is read as new, which is the only direction of error a viewer
// can afford.
//
// PROVISIONAL BYTES ARE NOT PRINTED. A batch is not committed until logstore
// removes pending.commit, and the next Open rolls an uncommitted tail back --
// correctly, since Append never returned, so nothing downstream ever learned those
// events existed. Every other reader here ignores that marker, and can: they print
// one state and are rerun. This one cannot take a line back once it has scrolled
// past, so it holds whole lines until logstore.BatchInFlight says the tail is
// durable. The exported helper documents why sampling the marker AFTER the read is
// what makes the answer sound.
//
// # Termination, ordered so it cannot lose the tail
//
// The writer lock is sampled BEFORE each read, and that order is the argument: if
// the lock is absent at T, nothing will append after T, so a read at any T' > T has
// already seen everything there is. Sampling it after the read inverts that and can
// stop one batch early.
//
// A run nobody is driving is not waited for. There is no --timeout to declare (the
// surface gives this verb a run id and nothing else), and a viewer that sat silent
// forever on a paused run would look identical to one watching a run that is merely
// thinking. So attach says which of the two it is, in the words the rest of the
// binary uses for it, and leaves. A run being driven is followed for as long as it
// is driven, with the pid out of writer.lock named so the user knows who they are
// waiting on.
//
//	0  the run reached a terminal state while attached, or had already ended
//	3  the follow stopped and the run had NOT ended -- nothing is appending to it
//	1  the run could not be read at all
//	2  the invocation was wrong
//
// 3 rather than 1 for "stopped without ending", and the same 3 `run result` uses, so
// a script polling either verb treats them alike: neither is a broken run, and
// neither should file a storage bug for a run that is waiting on a person.
//
// # Streams
//
// stdout is only ever event rows, one per line. The join header, the closing
// explanation and every warning go to stderr. So `arxi run attach r1 > live.txt`
// leaves a file of rows and nothing else, and under --json that file is valid
// NDJSON -- which is also why --json emits one raw kernel.Event per line rather
// than `event log --json`'s single document. A document has to be complete to
// parse, and completeness is what a live stream does not have.
