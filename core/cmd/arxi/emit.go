// `arxi event emit <run> <type> [--payload JSON]` -- the only way in from outside
// to wake a watcher a blueprint declared.
//
// # Why this verb, and why now
//
// `event log` was wired in the previous step and made the source of truth
// readable. It answers "what happened". This is the other half: the one verb that
// can make something happen that no other command can cause.
//
// Every other writer in this binary appends an event the reducer has a case for.
// `run prompt` appends run.prompt and applyInjection acts on it; `run pause`
// appends run.paused and the reducer sets a status. This one appends a type the
// reducer has NO case for -- and that is the point, not a limitation. A custom.*
// event falls through Decide's switch untouched and reaches the tail:
//
//	if !isWatcherDispatched(e.Type) && e.Source != SourceRuntime {
//	    fx = append(fx, wakeWatchers(&out, e, c)...)
//	}
//
// So a blueprint that declares `watchers: [{agent: qa, pattern: custom.*}]` has,
// until this command exists, declared a reaction to something nothing in the
// system can produce. The watcher machinery was reachable only from events the
// runtime happened to emit; the whole `custom.` namespace was a hole in the
// middle of it. This is the verb that fills the hole.
//
// # The declaration was written for the agent and did not survive the CLI
//
// The registry entry declared two parameters -- type and payload -- and no run.
// That reads correctly from inside a turn, where the run is ambient. From a shell
// it is unusable: there is no run to write to, resolveRunDir has no "the latest
// one" default, and no agent-side tool bridge exists yet (nothing outside
// internal/trigger/action.go so much as names this capability). The parameter was
// added to the surface rather than worked around here, because a command that
// took the run from an environment variable would be a second way to name a run.
// See the note on the entry in internal/surface/surface.go.
//
// # custom.* is enforced against everybody, not only agents
//
// spec/events.md says the namespace is reserved for agents and that agents may
// emit nothing else: "if they could emit stage.advanced, they could skip the
// advance rule of their own blueprint." That sentence was, before this file, a
// promise kept by nothing -- there was no emitter at all, so there was nothing to
// check it in.
//
// The obvious reading is that the restriction is an agent-side sandbox and a
// human at a terminal should be trusted with the other 32 types. That reading was
// rejected, and the reason is not trust:
//
//   - Each of the 32 catalogued types has a verb that maintains its invariants.
//     stage.advanced comes with a from/to/to_index the reducer indexes against
//     the blueprint's stage list; agent.blocked must bring blocked_ref or `run
//     why` reports a schema violation; run.result is what `run result` reads. A
//     hand-typed stage.advanced does not skip a safety check, it produces a log
//     that the fold and every reader afterwards disagree about.
//   - custom.* is the one namespace with NO invariant, which is exactly why an
//     outsider may write in it. Nothing downstream indexes it, so nothing
//     downstream can be corrupted by it.
//
// A human who genuinely needs to hand-write a catalogued event still can: the log
// is a file. What they cannot do is have this binary do it for them and then read
// the result back with commands that assume the invariants hold.
//
// # It drives the run, for the reason `run prompt` had to learn twice
//
// Appending and returning is not an option, and this is the second command in a
// row where that was the tempting mistake. wakeWatchers' effects -- CallTool, or
// SpawnTurn via spawnCauses -- live only in Decide's return value. Nobody
// executing them means they are discarded, so `event emit` would append an event,
// print success, and leave a matching watcher unfired. Indistinguishable, from
// the outside, from a watcher whose pattern was wrong.
//
// So: when a declared watcher matches AND the reducer would really act on it, the
// run is driven here. When none matches, nothing is driven and the command SAYS
// SO -- a recorded event nobody observes is a legitimate outcome (spec/events.md
// makes the same point about resource.conflict), but it is not the outcome a user
// typing this expects, and the difference has to be on screen.
