// `arxi run cancel`, exercised as a process against real run directories.
//
// # What is actually being tested
//
// The append is one event and the reducer arm is two lines, so nothing here is
// about whether the status changes. What is worth pinning is the set of claims
// the command makes around it, because each one is a thing a user acts on:
//
//   - it is FINAL, and the log agrees: a second cancel is refused, not recorded,
//     because cancelReason (runresult.go:261) quotes the FIRST run.cancelled and
//     the reducer ignores every event after a terminal one. A second cancel with
//     a better reason would be in the file and in no reading of it.
//   - --reason lands under the key `run result` reads, which is the difference
//     between an annotated abandonment and a run indistinguishable from a failure
//     (docs/design/20-use-cases.md:407)
//   - a question outstanding at the moment of the cancel becomes unanswerable,
//     and `arxi inbox` used to print "backend unblocked" for it anyway

// cancellableRun writes a run whose log folds to running, and returns nothing:
// the id is the caller's, as with pausableRun. Hand-written via runAt rather than
// started with --sim, because a --sim run drives itself to a terminal state and a
// terminal run is the one thing this command refuses.
