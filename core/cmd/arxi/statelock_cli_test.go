// `arxi state lock`, exercised as a process against real run directories.
//
// The lock is cooperative: it coordinates intent, and its entire value is that
// every reader of the fold agrees on ONE holder (docs/design/20-use-cases.md
// §20.8). So the defects worth guarding here are the ones where the command
// reports a claim that is not what the fold ends up holding:
//
//   - a key no other claimant would type the same way -- padded, empty -- which
//     guards nothing while reporting that it does, and both members carry on
//     editing the files;
//   - a lease the caller never chose: a malformed or negative --ttl clamped into
//     something plausible, or a default granted silently;
//   - a refusal with the wrong exit code. 3 means "ask again later", and the loop
//     in the usage line only terminates if a live lease exits 3 while a lock that
//     can NEVER lapse exits 1;
//   - a steal that is not atomic. The release and the acquire are one batch, and
//     any seq between them is a seq at which the key reads as free;
//   - an acquire that wakes a watcher and does not drive, or one that claims a
//     turn started when the run is halted and the cause is parked.
//
// # The clock is not pinned, and does not need to be
//
// nowFunc is a var so a test can pin it, but these tests exec the built binary as
// a subprocess, so nothing in this process reaches it. The lapse paths are driven
// from the fixture instead: an expiry in 2020 is lapsed at every real now, and one
// in 2099 is live for longer than this code will run. That is deterministic
// without injecting anything, and it exercises the same comparison a user hits.
//
// emitRunAt (emit_cli_test.go) is the fixture rather than runAt, per state_cli_test.go:
// a watcher must name a declared member, and the logs are hand-written because
// paused, blocked and terminal are not producible on demand by `run start --sim`.

// watchLock is the declaration a member makes to hear that a key changed hands.
const watchLock = "  - {agent: security, pattern: lock.*, action: notify}\n"

// watchLockRunsATool is the one action a halted run destroys rather than parks.
const watchLockRunsATool = "  - {agent: security, pattern: lock.*, action: run_tool, tool: read}\n"

// The three shapes of a lock somebody ELSE holds, which is the only case the CLI
// arbitrates: two shells are one holder, so a lock held by "human" is this
// command's own. The holder is named with `actor`, which is what lockHolder reads
// first -- these are the locks an agent's tool call takes, not a shell's.
//
// They start at seq 4 because emitRunAt's log now runs to seq 3: entering a stage
// commissions a turn for every non-advisory member, and the shared fixture closes
// security's so that these runs have a member free to be handed a cause.
//
// Each one then CLOSES a turn again at seq 5, and that second line is load-bearing
// wherever the run watches lock.*: the fixture's own lock.acquired matches that
// pattern, so folding it commissions a turn for security exactly as the release
// under test would. A log that stopped at the acquire would leave security
// permanently mid-turn, and emitWatcherOutcomes checks Busy() before almost
// anything -- every command into such a run answers "queued: security is mid-turn"
// whatever else is true of it, including the paused refusals, which then pass for
// the wrong reason. Under a watcher that does not match lock.* nothing is
// commissioned and the line closes nothing, which is inert.
