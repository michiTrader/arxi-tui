//
// All four are wired, so nothing in this group reaches notImplemented today. The
// fall-through stays anyway rather than becoming an "unknown verb" error: it reads
// the group from the registry, so a verb declared before it is built -- which is how
// every one of these four arrived, `unlock` last -- lists what the group does have
// instead of a message this function would have to keep in step by hand.
//
// That mechanism is the reason `arxi state unlock` was worth reaching for at all. It
// answered by listing `set`, `get` and `lock` for the whole life of the remedy
// internal/kernel/why.go hands out for a lock-blocked member, which is the best a
// dispatcher can do for a promise nothing kept.

// `arxi state set <run> <key> <value> [--if-seq N]` -- the write half of the run's
// shared key/value store.
//
// # What the store is for
//
// docs/design/20-use-cases.md §20.8: what one member wants another to know
// without paying for a turn to say it. The member that froze an API contract
// writes the key; whoever needs it reads it back, and nobody buys a turn to relay
// the message.
//
// # Why the write is an event and not a file beside the log
//
// Because `state = fold(Decide, State0, events)` has to stay true, and a KV file
// beside the log would make it false in the direction that is hardest to notice:
// the fold would rebuild every member, lock and inbox item from August and then
// read TODAY's value for a key an agent set last Tuesday, so a replay would not
// be a replay (spec/events.md §Shared state). The key's history is not lost by
// living in the log either -- it IS the log: `arxi event log <run> --type
// state.set`.
//
// # It drives the run, and that is the difference from writing a config file
//
// state.set is deliberately outside isWatcherDispatched and is not SourceRuntime,
// so a blueprint declaring `watchers: [{agent: backend, pattern: state.*}]` gets a
// turn when the contract it was waiting for lands. Those effects live only in
// Decide's return value, so appending and returning would leave a declared watcher
// unfired and indistinguishable from a pattern that never matched -- the same
// conclusion `event emit` and `run prompt` reached, the second one after shipping
// the bug.
