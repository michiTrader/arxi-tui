// `arxi state unlock <run> <key> [--force]` -- hand a cooperative lock back.
//
// # It was promised before it existed
//
// internal/kernel/why.go's `lock` arm has handed the user `arxi state unlock` as
// the remedy for a member blocked on a key since long before any registry entry
// declared the verb, and `state lock` sharpened that hole rather than filling it:
// the only lock.released it writes is a STEAL of a lapsed lease. So a holder that
// finished its work early had no way to say so, and the key stayed claimed until
// its lease ran out -- which for `--ttl 0` means until the run ends.
//
// # The three shapes, and why they are three
//
// The lock is cooperative, so who may release it is a CLI judgement and not a
// reducer one: releaseLock deliberately does not check the holder, because a
// release that only its holder could write could never reclaim a key from an agent
// that crashed mid-turn. That leaves this command to distinguish the cases, which
// it does by reason, all three of them values in the payload row spec/events.md
// already declares:
//
//   - our OWN lock -> reason "released". The ordinary case, no ceremony.
//   - somebody else's LAPSED lease -> reason "expired", carrying previous_holder
//     and expired_at, exactly as statelock.go's steal records it. The evidence for
//     the judgement goes in the log because the fold has no clock to re-take it.
//   - somebody else's LIVE lease -> reason "forced", and it needs --force. This is
//     the one that ends work in flight: the holder may be editing the files the key
//     guards, and it has been promised the key until an instant that has not
//     arrived.
//
// # Why --force is not asked for in the other two
//
// Not for our own lock, obviously. And deliberately not for a lapsed foreign lease
// either, even though that one takes the key from another name: `arxi state lock`
// already steals a lapsed lease with no flag at all, so
//
//	arxi state lock r1 migrations/ && arxi state unlock r1 migrations/
//
// frees it in two steps that nobody has to justify. Demanding ceremony on the
// one-step path would make the route that reclaims the key WITHOUT taking it
// first -- the safer of the two -- look like the more dangerous one.
//
// # SourceHuman, unlike the steal in statelock.go
//
// There the release was SourceRuntime because the lock.acquired batched behind it
// carried the wake, and waking a lock.* watcher twice bills two turns for one
// handover. Here the release is the whole event. Stamping it runtime would skip
// wakeWatchers outright, so a member declared to watch lock.* would not hear that
// the key it was waiting for is free -- which is the only news this command has.

// lockWaiter names a member blocked on this key, or "" if none is.
//
// Read off the blocked_ref the event catalogue requires of every agent.blocked
// (spec/events.md §The blocked_ref rule) via exactly the fields walkCause reads:
// Member.Detail is the `blocked_on` string and Member.BlockedOn is the reference
// map -- the two names are the other way round from what they describe, which is
// worth stating here because the plausible reading of the code is the wrong one.
// Going through the same pair means this reports a waiter exactly when `run why`
// would name one, instead of inventing a second notion of waiting.
//
// The state gate matches why.go's too. A member that is not MemberWaiting is not
// held up by this key even if it carries a stale reference to it, and reporting one
// would name a member that is working as blocked.
//
// The FIRST match is returned rather than all of them. One key has one holder, but
// any number of members can be waiting on it, and a release frees the key for
// whichever the run opens a turn for first. Naming one as an example is honest;
// naming one as the winner would not be, which is why the sentence around this says
// only that it is not woken.
