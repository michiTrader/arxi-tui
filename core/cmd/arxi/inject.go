// injection is the whole difference between `run prompt` and `run steer`: a
// noun, a participle, and the event type that lands in the log.
//
// # Why the two verbs share a body
//
// ADR-0005 has one injection mechanism, and that is not a figure of speech: in
// the reducer, run.prompt, agent.steered and agent.notified reach the same
// applyInjection, accumulate in the same PendingCauses, and drain into the same
// coalesced SpawnTurn. A CLI that implemented them twice would be free to
// disagree with that in ways no reducer test can see -- one verb refusing a
// paused run and the other parking a cause silently, one driving the run and
// the other leaving the cause to evaporate.
//
// The cost of copying is measured rather than hypothetical. `run prompt`
// shipped four defects that were found by running it: a cause appended and then
// discarded, a closing line advising a command that refuses, a wrong outlook on
// a halted run, and a refused CAS that exited holding the writer lock. A
// duplicated body would have carried all four into a second file, where each
// would have to be found a second time.
//
// # What genuinely differs
//
// Provenance. `prompt` records "here is something new to do"; `steer` records
// "what you are doing needs correcting". The reducer treats them identically on
// purpose, and the log keeps them apart so `event trace` can say which one
// caused a turn -- a change of direction, or a new requirement. That question is
// worth two event types even where the behaviour is one.
type injection struct {
	verb string           // the CLI verb: "prompt", "steer"
	typ  kernel.EventType // what is appended, and so what `event trace` shows
	past string           // the banner's participle: "prompted", "steered"

	// noun and is complete "a <noun> is <is>" in the refusal of an empty
	// message, which has to name what the caller failed to supply. "the message
	// is empty" on its own tells somebody who typed the wrong verb nothing.

	example string
}

// injectCause implements `arxi run <verb> <run> <text> [--to X] [--if-seq N]`.
//
// # This is a writer, and the first kind built here that is not a resume
//
// `run list`, `run show` and `run why` were projections: they read a log and
// could not corrupt it. This appends. The difference shows up in what has to be
// checked BEFORE the write, because after it the run has already been told
// something and an append-only log offers no way to unsay it.
//
// # Why the CAS is offered and not imposed
//
// --if-seq is ADR-0006's compare-and-swap. It is optional here, and defaulting
// it to "whatever the log is at right now" would be worse than leaving it off:
// that value is read microseconds before the append, so it would pass virtually
// always and give a caller the feeling of a guard without the guard. A CAS is
// only meaningful when the expected seq comes from the state the CALLER actually
// looked at -- the seq printed by `run show` or `run why`, minutes ago, before
// they decided what to say.
//
// So: no flag means "append regardless", which is what a human at a terminal
// almost always means. A flag means "only if nothing has happened since I
// looked", which is what a script or an agent means.

	//
	// An inbox reply is durable in the state: the fold sets Replied=true, so a
	// user who answers and stops can see that they answered, and the next drive
	// finds the answer waiting. A cause injected into a member who is neither
	// busy nor waiting leaves NOTHING. applyInjection sends it straight to
	// spawnCauses, and spawnCauses parks it only when spendingHalted -- which is
	// false on a running run. On every other path it returns a transient
	// SpawnTurn effect that lives in Decide's return value and is discarded if
	// nobody is executing effects.

	//
	//	$ arxi run prompt <run> "please submit what you have"
	//	run <run> prompted (seq 16), to backend
	//	$ arxi run why <run>

	// than the gap it was written to close: a refusal at least tells the truth.
	//
	// # Why the closing line could not fix it either
	//
	// The draft ended with "drive it: arxi run unpause <run>". That command
	// REFUSES a running run -- "already running, so there is nothing to resume",
	// exit 1 -- and quiescence is a running state. So the advice was itself a
	// printed-and-refused gap, printed by the command written to close the fifth
	// one. There is no other verb that drives. Not driving here does not defer the

	//
	// # What driving costs, and why that is the right price

	// paused and terminal runs up front, and a budget-exhausted run gets a
