// The role store, exercised as a process.
//
// # What a role is, and why that is what these tests are about
//
// `role define` writes defaults for `agent create --role <name>`: a tool grant
// and the advisory flag, nothing else. Those defaults are COPIED into the
// rendered agent as it is written and never read again. Every assertion here
// exists because that sentence has two halves that fail in opposite directions.
//
// The first half is that the copy happens at all. A role that is silently
// ignored looks exactly like a role that supplied nothing -- both print an agent
// and exit 0 -- so the only way to tell them apart is to read the file that came
// out. TestADefinedRoleFillsTheFlagsTheCommandLineLeftOut reads the YAML.
//
// The second half is that the copy is FROZEN. `run start` snapshots the
// blueprint, so a `role:` resolved at run time would put part of a run's rules
// outside the snapshot and let a redefinition change an agent somebody already
// reviewed. TestRedefiningARoleDoesNotReachTheAgentsThatCopiedIt deletes roles/
// outright and runs the agent anyway; if that ever fails, the design decision
// has been reversed by accident.
//
// # Why the subprocess
//
// Every interesting path in role.go and applyRole ends in os.Exit: an undefined
// role continues, a role file that will not parse does not, and the difference
// between those two is an exit code no in-process test can observe. The three
// refusals also each promise that nothing was written, which is a claim about the
// filesystem after the process died.
//
// # What is deliberately not here
//
// No test asserts that `role define` appears on the usage screen.
// TestTheUsageScreenListsWhatIsActuallyImplemented already walks the registry
// against the binary in both directions, so a wired verb missing from the screen
// -- or a screen entry naming an unwired verb -- is already a red build. A second
// list here would be a third copy of the same fact and the one nobody updates.

// writeRoleFile puts bytes in roles/<name>.json without going through the store.
//
// The unloadable cases need it because the store cannot produce them: Create
// validates, so a role file granting `reed` or holding `{ nope` can only arrive
// from a hand edit -- which is exactly how it will arrive in practice, since
// rolestore writes 0644 and the file is meant to be read and edited.
