// `arxi state set`, exercised as a process against real run directories.
//
// The store's whole purpose is that one member can tell another something
// without paying for a turn (docs/design/20-use-cases.md §20.8), so the defects
// worth guarding are the ones where the telling silently does not happen:
//
//   - a key written under a name `state get` cannot ask for -- padded, empty, or
//     carrying a newline -- reported as success;
//   - a write that wakes a watcher and does not drive, which leaves a matched
//     watcher that never fired and prints nothing about it;
//   - a write into a halted run, which stores the key legitimately and must NOT
//     claim a turn started -- and must refuse outright in the one case where the
//     reducer's answer is dropped rather than parked;
//   - a write into a terminal run, which the fold ignores entirely;
//   - a --if-seq that does not hold, refused under this command's own name and
//     leaving no writer.lock behind: two members writing one key is what the guard
//     is for, so this is the store's most ordinary failure rather than its rarest;
//   - a header that reaches the wrong audience -- source=runtime skips every
//     watcher, and an actor switches off that member's own watcher on state.*.
//
// emitRunAt (emit_cli_test.go) is the fixture, not runAt: a watcher must name a
// declared member, and this file is about which watcher a state.set matches. The
// logs are hand-written for the reason that file gives -- paused, blocked and
// terminal are not producible on demand by `run start --sim`.

// watchState is the declaration the store exists to serve: somebody who wants to
// be woken when a contract lands.

// keeps the fixture one a blueprint would accept.
