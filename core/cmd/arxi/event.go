// `arxi event log <run>` -- the log itself, which every other verb is a reading of.
//
// # Why this one, and why it is only a read
//
// ADR-0002 says the log is the source of truth and state.snapshot.json is a cache
// nothing reads. Every command built so far has honoured that by folding the log
// and printing a conclusion: `run show` prints a status, `run result` prints a
// deliverable, `run why` prints a diagnosis. When one of those conclusions is
// wrong, there has been no way to see the evidence it was drawn from except
// `cat runs/<id>/events.ndjson`, which is 21 lines of one-line JSON with the keys
// in alphabetical order. This is the verb that makes the source of truth readable
// by a person, so a disagreement between two commands can be settled by looking.
//
// It writes nothing and takes no lock, for the reason `run list` documents at
// length: the runs a reader most wants to inspect are the ones currently
// executing, and a viewer that refused those with "someone else is writing" would
// be useless exactly when it is needed.
//
// # What a real log turned out to look like
//
// MEASURED on a 21-event --sim run produced by this binary, before this file was
// written, because three of the decisions below are only defensible against real
// bytes:
//
//	 1 run.started      {"actor":"feature-team","blueprint_sha":"456be043…","budget_usd":5,"simulated":true}
//	 2 stage.entered    {"simulated":true,"stage":"plan"}
//	 3 agent.activated  {"agent":"backend","simulated":true}
//	...
//	21 run.result       {"result_from":"last_submit","summary":"all stages completed"}
//
// What those bytes settled:
//
//   - THERE IS NO USABLE TIMESTAMP. run.started carries "ts":"" and every other
//     event carries "ts":"1970-01-01T00:00:00Z", because --sim drives a virtual
//     clock. A TS column would therefore be twenty identical 1970s and one blank,
//     six characters of noise per row on the widest thing in the table. So there
//     is no column, and the footer reports the situation it measured on THIS log
//     rather than asserting a general rule -- a live run has real timestamps and
//     the footer says so instead. --json carries ts verbatim either way.
//
//   - SCOPE IS EMPTY ON EVERY EXECUTOR EVENT. agent.activated, llm.response,
//     stage.submitted and agent.turn_done all have "scope":"", and only the
//     reducer's own events carry "scope":"run:<id>". So this command selects
//     events by DIRECTORY and never by scope. A version that filtered on
//     scope == "run:"+id would have silently dropped the majority of a real log
//     while looking like it worked, which is the worst available failure: fewer
//     rows, no error.
//
//   - THE CAUSAL CHAIN IS BROKEN THROUGH THE EXECUTOR. Reducer events carry
//     correlation_id, caused_by and depth 1; executor events carry none of the
//     three and depth 0. That is a real gap in the producers rather than in this
//     reader, and it is why DEPTH is a column here: seeing a cascade flatten to
//     zero halfway down the log is how somebody will find it.
//
// # No key is hidden
//
// The payload is printed whole, keys sorted, one `key=value` per key. Individual
// VALUES are elided at a width, and when that happens the footer says so and
// points at --json; keys never are. A log viewer that quietly drops a field is
// worse than no log viewer, because it produces confident readings of evidence
// the reader cannot see -- and blueprint_sha, the one long value in a real log,
// is precisely the kind of thing somebody would go looking for after being told
// two runs were identical.
//
// # Quote the pattern
//
// The usage line says to quote --type, and that is a finding rather than
// pedantry: `--type stage.*` was run from a directory that happened to hold a
// file matching it, and the shell handed this command the FILENAME. The pattern
// then selected nothing, the no-match message dutifully listed the eight types
// present, and none of it mentioned the word the user actually typed. Nothing in
// a process can detect that substitution -- by the time main sees argv the
// original text is gone -- so the only available fix is to tell the reader,
// where they are already looking, before it happens.
