// Process-level guards for `arxi run why`.

// These run the built binary against run directories on disk, because that is

// gap was never in kernel.Explain, which had been tested since the kernel was
// written: it was that no caller existed, so `arxi run why <id>` -- the exact
// string three other commands print as advice -- answered "declared in the
// surface but not implemented yet". A unit test on Explain passed throughout.

// The remedy the binary prints must be a command the binary accepts.
//
// THE DEFECT: printRunSummary, printRunShow and cmdRunUnpause all told the user
// to run `arxi run why <id>`. Typing it answered:
//
//	arxi run why is declared in the surface but not implemented yet.
//
// This asserts on the class rather than on one caller: it takes the advice out
// of `run show`'s own output and runs it, so the two can never drift apart. If
// a future change makes run show suggest a different spelling, this test
// follows it there instead of pinning the string it happened to print today.
// The fixture is a plain RUNNING run, and that is not incidental. run show
// picks its closing line by what is true of the run: a blocked run with a
// pending question is sent to `arxi inbox`, a paused one to `run unpause`, and
// only an unfinished run with neither gets `run why`. A budget-blocked fixture
// here made this test fail while the code was correct -- run show was right to
// suggest the inbox -- so the fixture is chosen to reach the arm under test.
