// `arxi event emit`, exercised as a process against real run directories.
//
// This verb is the only one in the binary that lets something outside a run put
// a cause INTO it, so the defects worth guarding are not about what it computes.
// They are about the three ways it can lie to a person:
//
//   - by recording an event nobody watches while sounding like it started work
//     (the reverse of `run prompt`, which always starts work);
//   - by accepting `custom.*` -- the literal string `event log --type` taught
//     the user to type -- and minting an event whose name is a glob;
//   - by parking a cause in a halted run and exiting 0, which looks identical to
//     the command having worked.
//
// Every fixture below is a hand-written log, for the reason runresult's are: the
// statuses that matter here (paused, blocked, terminal, a member waiting) are
// not producible on demand by `run start --sim`, and a fixture built with the
// code under test cannot tell "the run was never there" from "the command
// failed to read it".

// emitRunAt writes a run whose blueprint declares watchers.
//
// runAt (runlist_cli_test.go) is reused everywhere else in this package, and is
// not reused here: its blueprint declares one member and NO watchers, and the
// whole subject of this file is which watcher a type matches. The roster below
// has two members because a watcher must name a declared member -- blueprint
// validation refuses `agent: qa` outright, which is how the "watcher names a
// member that does not exist" branch turned out to be unreachable.
//
// The seeded log closes security's turn, and that line is the fixture, not
// decoration. Entering a stage COMMISSIONS a turn for every non-advisory member
// (spawnFor sets Member.TurnOpen), so a log that stops at stage.entered describes
// a run in which everybody is permanently mid-turn -- and emitWatcherOutcomes
// checks Busy() before it checks anything a test here cares about. Every emit
// into such a run is "queued: security is mid-turn" whatever else is true of it:
// the paused and blocked refusals below never fire, because a cause that is
// parked behind a busy member is not a cause the halt withheld.
//
// backend's turn is deliberately left OPEN. A run in which nobody is busy and
// nobody is runnable is quiescent, and the loop that `event emit` drives says so
// by ending the run -- correctly, since neither member has submitted and
// advance_when is all. The fixture has to describe a run that is still alive, and
// one member still working is the cheapest honest way to be one.
