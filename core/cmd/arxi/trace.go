// `arxi event trace <event>` -- the causal chain of one event, root first.
//
// # Why this verb when `event log` already prints the log
//
// `event log` answers "what happened", in order. It cannot answer "what made
// THIS happen", because the answer is not a neighbouring line: caused_by names
// an id, and the event it names can be twenty lines up. Following it by eye means
// reading --json and grepping for an id, which is what this file automates.
//
// It adds no field, no index and no store. Every event in the log carries
// CausedBy, CorrelationID and Depth -- kernel.derived writes them on what the
// reducer emits, and exec.attribute copies the deciding effect's Cause onto what
// the executor writes -- and this is the reader those fields were written for.
//
// # MEASURED: this view is what proved the producers were the problem
//
// From a real 21-event --sim log written by this binary before the executor
// attributed anything:
//
//	 1 run.started      ev-start             src=human   depth 0  caused_by []
//	 2 stage.entered    ev-000002            src=runtime depth 1  caused_by [ev-start]
//	 3 agent.activated  sim-backend-act-1    src=runtime depth 0  caused_by []
//	11 stage.advanced   ev-000003            src=runtime depth 1  caused_by [sim-frontend-submit-1]
//	21 run.result       ev-000005            src=runtime depth 1  caused_by [sim-backend-submit-2]
//
// Five of twenty-one carried a cause. Every event the EXECUTOR wrote carried
// none, because exec.stamp filled in only ID and Ts: an agent turn was a hole in
// the chain, every correlation group was rooted at an executor event instead of at
// run.started, and depth 0 on all sixteen cleared the MaxDepth brake in
// wakeWatchers as if each were a root cause.
//
// The same run today, same blueprint, same 21 events: twenty of twenty-one carry a
// cause, all of them correlate to ev-start, and `event trace ev-000005` prints a
// six-event chain from run.started down. The one that records no cause is
// run.started, which is the root.
//
// The gap-reporting branches below survive that fix and are still written
// carefully, because they are how the next regression is seen. A reader shown one
// lonely event concludes this view is broken; a reader told "16 of these 21 events
// record no cause, so this log holds 16 causal threads" goes and looks at the
// producer.
//
// # Why an id, and why a seq is taken too
//
// caused_by names ids, so the chain can only be keyed on ids -- and `event log`'s
// human table has no ID column, so the only handle a reader arrives with is the
// seq they just read. Refusing it would make the answer to "trace line 12" be
// "run a different command with --json first". A numeric argument is therefore
// tried as an id FIRST and as a seq only when no log holds that id, and the
// header prints the id it resolved to so the next invocation can be keyed
// properly.
//
// # Why an id needs a run
//
// Ids are minted per run: exec.stamp counts from the log tip and formats
// ev-%06d, so ev-000002 exists in nearly every run directory. A bare id is
// therefore searched across every run and REFUSED when more than one holds it,
// with the qualified spellings printed, because picking the first would trace a
// stranger's log and look like it worked. `<run>/<event>` is the qualified form,
// and whether the left side is a run is decided by whether it holds an event log
// -- resolveRunDir's own rule rather than a second guess about slashes.
