// The README's "N of 49 declared capabilities are wired" figure, measured.
//
// The figure is deliberately not written into this comment. It moves every
// time a verb is wired, and a comment stating it would be one more copy to
// forget -- which is the failure this whole file exists to prevent.
//
// # Why this file exists
//
// The number was prose, arrived at by a shell probe run by hand and then typed
// into the README in four places. Nothing in the suite read it. A figure that
// only a human maintains is a figure that goes stale the first time somebody
// wires a command and forgets, and "the README overstates what works" is the
// one class of staleness a reader cannot detect from the inside.
//
// It went wrong in a worse way than staleness, though, and that is the actual
// reason for this file. The README described the probe as counting the paths
// that "do not answer *declared but not implemented*". The binary does not say
// that. It says:
//
//	arxi run replay is declared in the surface but not implemented yet.
//
// Rebuilding the probe from the README's wording -- which is what a reader
// checking the claim would do, and is exactly what happened -- produces a
// pattern that matches nothing, so every one of the 49 paths fell into the
// "implemented" bucket and the probe reported 49/49, 100.0%. A verification tool
// that cannot fail reports total success. The 100% was believable enough to
// stop and diagnose only because 25 unwired commands do not appear in an
// afternoon.
//
// That tell is gone. The surface is wired end to end now, so a sentinel that
// matches nothing reports 50 of 50 and 100.0% -- which is the right answer,
// arrived at by measuring nothing. Nobody stops to diagnose a number that
// agrees with the README.
//
// So the guard below does two separate jobs, and the second is the one the
// hand-run probe could never do:
//
//  1. Count the wired capabilities and compare against the README.
//  2. Assert the sentinel this count depends on is really the binary's wording,
//     and that an unrecognised path still reaches the code that prints it.
//
// Without (2), (1) is the same trap one layer up: a sentinel that stops
// matching turns this test into one that certifies 100% and passes.
//
// # Why the count is "did not refuse" rather than "succeeded"
//
// A wired command invoked with no arguments mostly fails -- `arxi trigger show`
// wants a name, `arxi eval run` wants two flags. Those failures come from the
// command's own flag checking, which means the executor ran, which is the thing
// being counted. Requiring success would need a valid invocation for all 50 and
// would measure fixture-building rather than wiring. The distinction that
// matters to a user is only ever "does this verb exist yet", and the binary
// answers exactly that question in one sentence.
//
// The 24 commands wired at the time were read by eye once against this rule, and
// none was a false positive: 20 printed their own usage or flag error, and
// `model list`, `trigger list`, `inbox` and `eval list` printed real (empty)
// output. Every verb wired since has been held to the same rule, and `design` is
// the one worth naming: probed here it prints "not a terminal" and exits
// nonzero, because this runner closes stdin. That is the executor running and
// refusing an environment, not a gap in the surface, so counting it as
// implemented is right -- and design_test.go pins that wording apart from a
// refusal, so the two answers cannot become the same sentence.

// notImplementedSentinel is the phrase the binary prints for a declared command
// with no executor behind it, and the test below checks it against
// notImplementedMessage in cmd/arxi/main.go rather than trusting this copy.
//
// Not a shortened paraphrase. The README's paraphrase is what broke the probe,
// and a sentinel is the one string in a test that must never be approximated:
// shortening it cannot make the test fail loudly, only make it stop finding
// anything, and this test's failure mode from over-matching is silence.
const notImplementedSentinel = "is declared in the surface but not implemented yet"

// blockingPaths are declared paths that do not return on their own.
//
// `trigger run` is a watcher: it prints "watching 0 trigger(s)" and then sleeps
// until interrupted, so probing it costs the whole timeout. It is counted as
// implemented by inspection rather than by invocation, and the count below says
// so out loud instead of quietly skipping it -- a skipped entry is how a probe
// silently loses part of its denominator.
//
// `serve` is NOT here, and that is deliberate: it terminates on EOF, and every
// invocation in this file gets a closed stdin. An earlier hand-run probe let
// serve inherit the shell's stdin, where it read the list of paths being probed
// and swallowed two of them, reporting 22/47 against a registry of 49. Closing
// stdin per invocation is what makes serve safe to probe, so the fix lives in
// the runner rather than in an exception list.

	// This was a canary for most of its life: run the binary against a path that
	// was declared and had no executor, and check the sentinel came back. It moved
	// four times, from `run replay` to `run attach` to `run steer` to `state lock`
	// to `design`, and every move happened because the verb got built. `design`

	// looking exactly like it asserts something.
	//
	// So the same question is now asked in two pieces, neither of which needs an
	// unbuilt verb in order to mean something:
	//
	//  1. the sentinel is read out of the function that prints it, so it cannot
	//     drift into a paraphrase that quietly matches nothing;

	//     verb that is misspelled rather than unbuilt -- the same call, the same
	//     walk back up the prefixes, a different sentence at the end of it.
