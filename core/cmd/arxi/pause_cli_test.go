// `arxi run pause`, exercised as a process against real run directories.
//
// # Why a verb this small needs this many tests
//
// The command appends one event with no payload and prints four lines, and
// almost none of what matters about it is in that append. What matters is what
// it REFUSES and what it says while doing it, and every one of those is a
// property of the binary in a real directory:
//
//   - a typo'd run id must not create runs/<typo>/, and logstore.Open MkdirAll's
//     its directory, so the only thing standing between a typo and a junk
//     directory is the order of two calls in this file
//   - a run that is being driven cannot be paused, and the raw lock error's
//     advice ("remove writer.lock by hand") is dangerous in exactly this case
//   - pausing a BLOCKED run overwrites the block in Status, and `run why`
//     branches on Status first (internal/kernel/why.go:44), so the diagnosis
//     stops being reachable one event after this command runs
//
// The last of those has a sibling in `run unpause`, and it is pinned here rather
// than there on purpose: the defect only exists on a run that was paused, so the
// test that finds it has to pause one.

// pausableRun writes a run whose log folds to running, and returns its id.
//
// Hand-written via runAt (runlist_cli_test.go), because a run started with
// `run start --sim` drives itself to a terminal state and a terminal run is the
// one thing this command refuses. A run that is merely running is not a state
// the simulator will hold still in.
