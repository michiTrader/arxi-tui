// `arxi run show <run>` -- the second reading of the same fold.
//
// # What this adds over `run list`
//
// `run list` answers "which runs exist and which one needs me". This answers
// "what is true of THIS one", and the difference is entirely in what may be
// left out. A table has to elide: it has one line per run, so members, locks
// and the text of a question cannot appear in it. A detail view has the room,
// and its whole justification is spending that room on what the table dropped.
//
// So this is deliberately not a one-run table. If it printed the same seven
// columns for a single id it would be a worse `run list --status`, and the verb
// would exist only to make the surface count go up.
//
// # It reuses the resolver rather than re-deriving it
//
// resolveRunDir and foldRunDir already exist, written for `run unpause`. Using
// them means `run show <id>` and `run unpause <id>` cannot disagree about which
// directory an id names, and that they accept a path in the same cases. A
// second resolver would be a second set of rules to keep in sync, and the first
// symptom of drift would be `run show` describing a run that `run unpause`
// then says does not exist.
//
// foldRunDir also carries the simulated flag, which the State does not: the
// reducer has no use for the distinction, so run.started is the only place it
// survives. That matters here more than anywhere else, because the number this
// view puts on screen is a dollar amount, and "$0.42" from a simulated run is
// not a bill.
