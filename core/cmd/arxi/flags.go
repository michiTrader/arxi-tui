// expandShort rewrites short flags into their long form before any command's
// parser sees them, using the surface's own assignment.
//
// It exists so the three parsers in this package cannot disagree about what a
// letter means. Teaching each one about `-p` separately is how `-b` ends up
// being budget in run start and base-url in provider add: nothing forces the
// two to match, and the day they differ neither is wrong on its own terms.
// Expanding first means every parser keeps handling exactly one spelling, the
// long one, and the short forms cannot drift from the registry because they are
// read out of it.
//
// The rewrite is deliberately dumb: it maps a letter to a name and stops. It
// does not validate values, so a command's own parser still rejects everything
// it would have rejected before. A pre-pass that also validated would be a
// second place where "is this flag legal here" is decided, and the two answers
// would eventually differ.
