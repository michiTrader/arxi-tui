// `run start` that takes a name had no process-level coverage in any file, and
// internal/agentstore's own tests cannot see any of what follows, because none of
// it happens in that package.
//
// The gap shipped a defect. `agent create` wrote a stageless blueprint and
// printed `run it:` underneath it; applyRunStarted activates the members of the
// stage it enters and returns nil when the config declares none, so the run
// started, entered nothing, spawned no turn, and recorded run.quiescent as its
// second event. blueprint.Load accepted the file, `blueprint validate` passed it,
// `agent show` printed it, and the store's own test asserted the absence of a
// `stages:` block AS A FEATURE. Starting one by hand was the only thing that
// found it -- which is exactly the step no test in the tree was taking.
//
// Asserted through the log the reducer produced rather than by looking for
// `stages:` in the file: the stage is the mechanism, being asked to work is the
// property. A future runtime that spawns a turn for a lone member with no stage
// declared should make this test pass, not fail.
