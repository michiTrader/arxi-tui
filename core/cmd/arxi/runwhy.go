// `arxi run why <run>` -- the remedy this binary printed and then refused.
//
// # Why this one, and why now
//
// Three places in this codebase tell a user to run `arxi run why <id>`:
// printRunSummary after every unfinished run, printRunShow, and cmdRunUnpause
// when it declines to resume a run that is already running. Following that
// advice verbatim answered:
//
//	arxi run why is declared in the surface but not implemented yet.
//
// A gap of that kind is discovered by the person already in trouble. Their run
// has stopped, the tool has told them what to type, and the thing it told them
// to type does not exist. The README calls this the worst class of gap in the
// project and counts them; this was a fourth, reintroduced by `run show` and
// inherited from `run start`.
//
// # The diagnosis was already built
//
// kernel.Explain walks the wait graph and returns a Why: the cause tree and the
// concrete commands that unblock it. It has been tested since the kernel was
// written. What was missing is the same thing that was missing for `run list`
// and `run show` -- a caller that reads a run off disk and hands it over.
//
// # Why `arxi why <file.json>` still works
//
// The older spelling takes a PATH to a state file, and it is how the reducer's
// purity is demonstrated: `run why` needs no executor, no store, and no run
// directory, only a State. Removing it to make room for run ids would delete
// that demonstration and break testdata/scenarios, so both are accepted and the
// argument is classified by what it is rather than by which verb was typed.
//
// Deciding by "does this name a run directory" and falling back to "treat it as
// a file" means a user never has to know which form a command wants. It is the
// same judgement resolveRunDir already makes for paths versus ids.
