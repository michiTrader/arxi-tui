// `arxi run attach`, exercised as a process against a log the test is appending to.
//
// # Why this file needed machinery the other CLI tests did not
//
// Every other run verb is a function of bytes that are already on disk: write a
// fixture, run the binary, read what it printed. This one is a function of bytes
// that arrive WHILE it runs, and three of its four promises are unobservable if the
// test writes the whole log first:
//
//   - it joins at the head, so the twelve events that already exist are NOT printed
//   - an event split across two writes is printed once, whole
//   - a batch that was never committed is not printed at all
//
// A fixture written before the process starts turns all three into the same trivial
// case. So the tests below start the binary, wait for its join header, and only then
// append -- which is also the only ordering under which "printed only what arrived
// after it" means anything.
//
// # Every invocation is bounded, and that is an assertion
//
// The follow loop has exactly two exits: the run reaches a terminal state, or the
// writer lock goes away. A defect in either check does not produce a wrong answer,
// it produces no answer -- and an unbounded exec in a Go test does not fail, it
// hangs the whole package until the 10-minute timeout and reports a goroutine dump
// with no test name (scheduler_cli_test.go documents that happening). So there is no
// plain exec here at all: startAttach kills the process group at a deadline and
// finish() fails with both streams, naming the exit that did not happen.
//
// # The fixtures hand-write writer.lock, and nothing checks the pid
//
// A follower decides "somebody is appending" by the presence of the lock file and
// names its contents so the user knows who they are waiting on. It does not signal
// the pid, and does not ask the OS whether it is alive -- deliberately, since a
// viewer that probed or reaped the writer would be a viewer that can break the run
// it is watching. That is what makes these fixtures possible: `pid 4242` is a lock
// held by nobody, which is precisely a live writer as far as this verb can tell.
//
// The lock path comes from logstore.LockPath rather than the string "writer.lock",
// so the fixture and the binary read one constant. pending.commit is spelled out
// (the package exports no path for it) and the fixture immediately asserts
// logstore.BatchInFlight agrees -- otherwise a rename would leave that test quietly
// exercising nothing, which is the failure mode surface_coverage_test.go exists for.

// attachTestDeadline is how long any single invocation below may take.
//
// Generous rather than tight: these tests append on a 120 ms poll interval and run
// alongside the rest of the package, so a slow machine must not fail them. It is a
// backstop against a hang, not a performance assertion.

// TestRunAttachInitialJoinExcludesThenPrintsAProvisionalCompleteEventOnce has
// failed intermittently under parallel package load, and has NOT been explained.
//
// Recording what an investigation ruled out, so the next person does not spend
// the same hours re-refuting it. Roughly 70 executions on Linux (go1.23.4, 2
// CPUs) failed to reproduce it, under each of:
//
//   - -count=25 with six busy-loop processes saturating both CPUs;
//   - -count=15 under -race (no data race reported);
//   - the full package, four consecutive runs, which is the shape it was
//     originally seen in.
//
// Three hypotheses were tested and are wrong:
//
//  1. eventually's 5s budget being too small under load. Shrinking it to 150ms
//     and then to 1ms did not fail the test, so the waits are not close to
//     their deadline -- the handshake resolves almost immediately.
//  2. the join handshake racing the binary's first read. It does not: attach
//     reads the log (attach.go readRunLog, which fixes v.consumed) well before
//     it prints "attached to", so a fixture that waits for the header is
//     provably behind the read offset the test reasons about.
//  3. a data race in the follower. -race is clean across 15 iterations.
//
// A fourth was tested later and is also wrong:
//
//  4. the pending.commit marker rewinding the follower's read offset. This one
//     was half right, which is why it needed measuring rather than reasoning.
//     logstore.ReadConfirmed's NextOffset is genuinely NOT monotonic: a marker
//     naming a rollback point behind what the caller consumed pulls the
//     reported boundary backwards (20 -> 10, measured). But followRunLog only
//     assigns consumed = read.NextOffset inside `if len(read.Bytes) > 0`, and
//     a rewound read serves no bytes, so the assignment is unreachable on
//     exactly the passes that could move it back. The follower cannot
//     re-print. See internal/logstore/pending_race_test.go, which pins both
//     halves -- the rewind is real, and the guard is what makes it harmless.
//
// What that leaves un-eliminated: anything specific to the machine the
// original failures were seen on (Windows and WSL). Every mechanism reachable
// on Linux that was proposed has now been tested and refuted, so the next step
// is a reproduction on the platform where it was seen -- NOT a speculative
// change to the waits, which this evidence says are not the problem.
