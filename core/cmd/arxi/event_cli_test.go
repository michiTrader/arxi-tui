// `arxi event log`, exercised as a process against real run directories.
//
// # Why a viewer needs tests at all
//
// It computes nothing. Every figure it prints is already in the log, which makes
// it look like the one command where a bug cannot matter. The opposite is true:
// every other verb in this binary summarises, and this is the one a person opens
// when they have stopped believing the summaries. A viewer that hides a field, or
// prints a value that is not in the file, is worse than no viewer -- it produces a
// confident reading of evidence the reader cannot see.
//
// So the assertions below are about DISCLOSURE rather than about arithmetic: that
// no payload key is dropped, that a filter which selects nothing says what the log
// does hold, that the exit code distinguishes "no match" from "bad flag", and that
// stdout is empty in every case where there is no table.
//
// # The fixtures are hand-written, and the shapes came out of a real log
//
// The seq numbers, the empty `scope` on executor events and the depth-0/depth-1
// split are not invented for the test. They are what `run start --sim` wrote,
// checked against a 21-event log before any of this was asserted: the reducer
// stamped scope, correlation_id, caused_by and depth 1; the executor stamped none
// of the four.
//
// The executor attributes its events now (exec.attribute), so that log is the OLD
// shape -- and the fixtures deliberately keep it. Logs written before the fix are
// still on disk and still get read, so the viewer has to survive them; and a
// fixture where everything carries a cause would leave the footer's root-count
// note unreachable in the suite, which is the note that would report the next
// producer regression.

// logAt writes a run whose log has the shapes this viewer has to survive.
//
// runAt already supplies run.started at seq 1 and stage.entered at seq 2, so the
// extras start at 3. The events here are deliberately mixed: two with no cause and
// no scope (the executor's shape before it attributed anything), one with both
// (the reducer's), and one carrying a 64-character sha so elision is exercised by
// a value the system really writes rather than by a string invented to be long.
