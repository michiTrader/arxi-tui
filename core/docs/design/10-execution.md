# 10. The execution model

## 10.1 A single function decides

All of arxi turns around one function:

```go
Decide(State, Event, Config) -> (State', []Effect)
```

Pure. It does not look at the clock, does not touch the network, does not write
anything. Everything it wants to happen in the world it **describes** as an
`Effect` and returns; somebody else runs it.

That restriction is not aesthetic. It is what makes four features be the same
feature instead of four programs that have to be kept in sync:

| feature | what it is |
|---|---|
| `arxi run` | fold + real executor |
| `arxi run --sim` | fold + fake executor |
| `arxi run replay` | fold over an old log, with no executor |
| `arxi run why` | read the `State` that came out of the fold |

In a design where the reducer calls the network, `replay` is a separate program
that reimplements the logic of the main one. It is always out of date and nobody
notices until they need it.

Purity is verified, not promised: `internal/arch_test.go` runs `go list` over the
package and fails if the kernel imports `time`, `net`, `os`, `math/rand` or
anything in that family. The error message explains why it is wrong and what to
do instead.

## 10.2 The log is the truth

```
State = fold(Decide, State0, events)
```

Snapshots are cache. If a snapshot and the log disagree, **the log wins**.

Two consequences with teeth:

**The blueprint is frozen at start.** The run stores `blueprint_sha` and the
reducer never reads the live file, but the copy in
`runs/<id>/blueprint.snapshot.yaml`. Without this, replaying a run from last week
would use today's config and give a different result — which is the same as
having no replay.

**The reducer does not assign `seq`.** The events it returns via `Emit` carry
`seq: 0`. The sequence number is assigned by the single log writer. The reducer
does not know what global order what it emits will land in, and pretending it
does is inventing a race.

## 10.3 Two effect classes

If `Decide` returns `[]Effect`, does the executor run them in order or in
parallel?

Neither simple answer works. "All in parallel" breaks correctness: `Emit` and
`SetTimer` change what the rest of the system is going to see. "All in order"
serializes three agent turns that know nothing about each other, and that is
where the reason the tool exists gets lost.

So each effect declares its class:

- **`ClassControl`** — changes the observable state of the run or the clock.
  `Emit`, `SetTimer`, `CancelTimer`, `Snapshot`. They run **in the exact order of
  the list**, one after another.
- **`ClassIndependent`** — only affects itself. `SpawnTurn`, `CallTool`,
  `AskHuman`. They can run **in parallel** with each other.

`Decide` sorts the list before returning it (`orderEffects`), so the executor
needs only one rule: run the control prefix sequentially, then the rest
concurrently.

The sort uses `sort.SliceStable`, not `sort.Slice`. The relative order among the
`Emit`s is semantic — `stage.advanced` has to go before `stage.entered` — and an
unstable sort would break it intermittently, which is the worst way to break.

## 10.4 Quiescence: the failure mode nobody specifies

The most expensive failure mode of a multi-agent system is not the crash. It is
silence: the run does not fail, does not finish, does not advance. Things stop
happening. The user finds out the next morning that they spent forty dollars on
nothing.

`Decide` checks quiescence **at the end of every step**. If nobody is busy,
nobody is wakeable, there is no armed timer, there are no unanswered questions
and no pending effect is going to generate an event, then it emits
`run.quiescent`.

Three decisions that matter:

**It is an event, not a terminal state.** Turning it into `StatusQuiescent` was
the obvious temptation and would have been the worst mistake in the design. The
event wakes the observer and the run recovers. Only if **nobody** observes it does
the run fail — and it fails carrying the diagnosis with it.

**It carries a required diagnosis.** "The run is idle" is useless to everybody.
The payload says which rule is not met:

```
stage review advances with quorum:3 and it is not met; everyone who could has
already submitted: the rule is unsatisfiable with this blueprint
```

That case — the rule asks for three submissions and only two members can submit —
is the hardest to debug by eye, because everybody "complied" and the blueprint
looks correct.

**`submitted` is not `runnable`.** The subtlety that made the first
implementation fail. A member who already submitted looks available (not
thinking, not waiting) but has nothing to do. Counting them as runnable means
quiescence is **never** detected, and the bug is invisible: the system looks
eternally healthy while being stuck forever.

## 10.5 One mechanism, three features

`run.prompt`, `agent.steered` and `agent.notified` are the same mechanism with
different provenance: text arrives for somebody.

If the addressee is busy, the text is neither lost nor does it open a parallel
turn. It accumulates in `PendingCauses` and is drained **all together** in the
next turn.

That IS `on_busy: queue`. And `queue` IS follow-up. And the draining IS
coalescing. Three features from the requirements document, one twenty-line
machine.

The saving is direct: if five events wake the same agent while it is busy,
**one** turn is opened with five causes in the context, not five turns.
Literally 5x on the invoice. The `Coalesced` field of the effect records how many
were merged, so the saving is auditable and not a marketing claim.

## 10.6 The two filters that run before spending

A watcher over `agent.*` that reacts to its own events is an infinite loop with a
credit card. Two cheap filters run **before** generating a single expensive
effect:

1. **Self-exclusion** (`include_self: false` by default). A watcher is not woken
   by its own events. This is a default, not a prohibition: there are legitimate
   patterns that need to see themselves, and `include_self: true` enables it
   explicitly.
2. **Depth limit** (`max_depth: 12`). Every derived event increments `depth`.
   Without this, a watcher reacting to what another watcher caused has no floor.

## 10.7 The budget belongs to the tree, not to the run

`State.TreeSpentUSD` accumulates the spending of the whole subtree. A child run
consumes from the parent's pool.

Without this, N levels of spawn multiply the ceiling by N and the `--budget` of
the root run is decorative. With this, `--budget 10` means ten dollars, no matter
how many levels of delegation show up.

And when it runs out: **block and ask, do not kill**. The work done up to that
point is worth real money that has already been spent. The human decides whether
to raise the ceiling or stop.

## 10.8 The defaults are security decisions

| default | why |
|---|---|
| workspace source and tool profile | Resolution selects `copy` for file-only writers, `worktree` for `bash` users, `shared` for readers and `none` for text-only members, but preflight accepts only advertised native guarantees. Windows currently advertises `none`/`no-tools`. Linux advertises that plus `shared` with the read-only `direct-files-read` profile (ADR-0017) and `copy` with the write-capable `direct-files` profile (ADR-0019), so read/grep runs against the frozen tracked tree and write/edit runs against a per-member snapshot are both accepted; writing `shared` is not. `bash` runs still fail before `run.started`, because `worktree` and `contained-process` remain unadvertised. An internal provisioner or process runner is not availability until the production capability decision guarantees its full contract. |
| `on_timeout: escalate` | A timeout almost never means "impossible", it means "something got stuck, go look". Failing by default trains the user to set absurdly long timeouts, which is worse than having none. |
| `activation: coalesce` | The alternative multiplies the invoice in exchange for nothing. |
| `include_self: false` | See §10.6. |
| undeclared tool policy → `deny` | A permissive default turns every oversight into a silent hole. |
| `--budget` with no default, mandatory | An invisible ceiling is a surprise invoice. Making the user type the number is the only way to be sure they know it exists. |

## 10.9 What the compiler guarantees and what the tests guarantee

Go has no exhaustive enums. `Effect` is a sealed interface (unexported method
`isEffect()`), so nobody from outside can add variants, but the compiler does not
require a `switch` to cover them all.

The replacement is mechanical: `allEffectVariants` registers the seven, and
`TestEffectExhaustive` fails if the count does not match — with a message that
says exactly what to do:

```
registered variants = 8, expected 7.
If you added an Effect variant, add it to allEffectVariants and review ALL the
switches over Effect (grep 'case SpawnTurn').
```

It is worse than a Rust `match`. The compensation is in the other direction:
`go list` lets us verify the import graph, and `TestKernelIsPure` turns "the
kernel is pure" into something CI checks instead of something you remember. See
ADR-0007.

## 10.10 The runner, as built

§10.3 gives the rule. `internal/exec` implements it, and implementing it forced
four decisions the rule alone does not settle.

**An unordered list is refused, not fixed.** `Decide` already sorts, so the
runner could simply trust the order. It verifies it instead, and returns
`ErrUnorderedEffects` if a control effect appears after an independent one.

Re-sorting would be the friendlier choice and the wrong one: it would hide a bug
in `orderEffects` whose symptom is an `Emit` running inside the parallel group.
The run would then finish in one of two different ways depending on which
goroutine got scheduled first, and that is the failure mode that never
reproduces on the machine where it is being debugged.

**Independent results are appended in list order, never in completion order.**
Replay reads the log, so whatever order landed there becomes the truth and replay
stays faithful either way. But if the append order followed whichever provider
answered first, two `--sim` runs over identical input would produce different
logs, and `run diff` could no longer tell a real change from scheduling noise.
The cost of the guarantee is one slice of results indexed by position.

**A failing effect does not discard its siblings.** By the time one `SpawnTurn`
errors, the other two have already spent real money and the `CallTool` has
already written to the filesystem. Dropping their events would leave the log
describing a world that does not exist — the one thing the log is not allowed to
do. So every effect's events are appended first, and its error is recorded
afterwards, in a `Result.Errs` slice rather than a single error: with two of five
effects broken, the operator needs both reasons, not the first one.

This is also why an effect may legitimately return **events and an error at the
same time**. The two are different facts:

| Situation | Event written | Error returned |
|---|---|---|
| Tool ran, exited non-zero | `tool.call_completed`, the exit status in `result` | no |
| Provider refused the prompt | `llm.response` with `ok: false`, then `agent.turn_done` | no |
| Provider requested an allowed native tool call | `tool.call`, exact `tool.call_completed`, then the final `llm.response` and `agent.turn_done` | no |
| Provider requested a native tool call stopped by `ask` or `deny` | `tool.call`, `tool.call_denied`, then `llm.response` and `agent.turn_done` | no |
| Connection reset before the turn landed | `agent.failed`, the provider's message in `error` | yes |
| Context cancelled mid-turn | `agent.failed`, the cancellation in `error` | yes |
| A tool call could not be delivered | none | yes |

A domain failure **happened**, so it belongs in the log. A transport failure means
nothing can be said about what the agent did, and the log is the one place that may
not contain guesses — so none of the last three rows says anything about that. Two
of them write an event anyway, because a second fact is in play that is not a
guess: this run commissioned a turn, and that turn is not going to arrive.

The first row carries no `ok` flag, and that is deliberate rather than an
omission: `tool.call_completed`'s payload is `{tool, result?}` and a non-zero exit
is an **answer**, not an error — "the tests fail" is precisely what the agent
asked to find out, so it travels as text the next turn reads. A bool could not
carry it anyway. `bash` has three outcomes, not two, and the third is a timeout,
where nothing was learned about whether the command would have succeeded; every
tool without an exit code would report success unconditionally.

The second row said `agent.failed` until it was read against the code. What a
refusal actually writes is `llm.response` carrying `ok: false`, `error`, `status`
and `retryable`, followed by `agent.turn_done`
(`internal/provider/executor.go:210`). The `turn_done` is not optional: the turn
is over either way, and a member left `thinking` after a refusal is a run that
goes silent with no diagnosis — §10.4's failure mode arrived at by a bug instead
of by a blueprint. The status travels separately from the message because `run
why` has to tell a rate limit from a bad key, and only one of those is worth
retrying.

The last two rows write `agent.failed` (`turnFailure`,
`internal/exec/exec.go:434`), and the reason is in the state rather than in the
diagnosis. Entering a stage **commissions** a turn per member — `spawnFor` sets
`Member.TurnOpen` (`internal/kernel/decide.go:1260`) and `Busy()` is true for as
long as that flag is set — and `agent.turn_done` is the only event that clears it
(`internal/kernel/decide.go:753`). A `SpawnTurn` that returns an error without one
therefore leaves behind a member the reducer believes is working, for the rest of
the run: quiescence can never fire again, and the genuine stall three stages later
is reported as nothing at all. `Result.Errs` cannot close it — `Errs` belongs to one
step and dies with the process, while the state is rebuilt by folding the log, so
anything the state has to survive on has to *be* in the log.

The condition is "no `agent.turn_done` among the events the effect did produce",
not "no events at all": a turn that wrote `agent.activated` and then died has the
same disease, and the refusal in the second row has already closed its own turn and
must **not** be marked failed, since `MemberFailed` takes the member out of every
later stage. And only `SpawnTurn`. A `CallTool` or `AskHuman` that fails strands
nothing — the member is left where it was, and the reducer's own timers and blocks
still apply — so inventing an event for those would be exactly the guess this rule
forbids. What gets recorded is not a claim about what the agent did. It is that a
turn this run commissioned did not happen.

This is the emitter an earlier draft of this section recorded as missing.
`agent.failed` was declared (`internal/kernel/event.go:38`), reduced to
`MemberFailed` (`internal/kernel/decide.go:87`) and catalogued
(`spec/events.md:76`) with nothing in the tree writing it — a watcher on
`agent.failed` loaded, validated, and never fired. It fires now.

**A control failure aborts the step before anything is spent.** If an `Emit`
cannot be written, the independent tail never runs. The tail was decided under
the assumption that the control effects took place, so spawning turns afterwards
means paying a provider to act on a state that never existed.

### Snapshots

`Snapshot` means “capture now”; it carries no sequence chosen by the reducer.
When the effect runs, the preceding control `Emit`s have already committed, so
the runner reads the confirmed log head, re-folds exactly through that sequence,
and writes the state tagged with that same sequence. Passing the source event's
sequence would snapshot the state before the very transition that requested it;
using `0` as an implicit head would make the boundary a convention rather than an
invariant. The required equality is literal:

```
snapshot.State == Fold(config, snapshot.Seq)
```

A snapshot that cannot be written does not fail the run. The run is still
entirely correct, only slower to inspect. Aborting because a cache write failed
would invert ADR-0002 and make an optimization mandatory: a read-only disk would
start killing runs that are otherwise fine. The skip is counted in
`Result.SnapshotSkipped`, because *not fatal* must not mean *invisible* — a
permanently failing cache would otherwise leave `run show` mysteriously slow
forever with nothing to point at.

## 10.11 Time is injected

`SetTimer` carries a **relative offset in milliseconds**, never an absolute
instant. That single choice is what makes timeouts testable: a stage with a
thirty-minute timeout is exercised in microseconds by a virtual clock.

The alternative is not "slower tests", it is **untested timeouts**. Nobody keeps
a suite that takes half an hour, so those paths would be skipped, and the first
real execution of the timeout code would be at 3am on a run that matters.

Two implementations, one interface:

- `VirtualClock` — used by `--sim` and by every test. Time moves only when
  `Advance` is called, which makes the firing order of timers a fact of the test
  instead of a race against the machine's scheduler. It starts at `t=0`, not at
  `time.Now()`, so a simulated log is never mistakable at a glance for a real one.
- `RealClock` — records wall-clock deadlines and is **polled**, not built on
  `time.AfterFunc`. A callback-based real clock would need a mechanism the
  virtual clock deliberately does not have, and the run loop in `run` and the run
  loop in `--sim` would stop being the same code.

Both are deliberately identical in what they accept and reject, because a
blueprint that simulates cleanly must not still fail on a real run — that would
make `--sim` an unsafe place to discover problems.

Three behaviours are worth naming:

- **Ties are broken by timer id.** Go randomizes map iteration on purpose, so two
  timers armed for the same instant would otherwise fire in a different order on
  each execution. That alone would make `--sim` produce a different log from
  identical input.
- **Re-arming an id overwrites it.** Re-entering a stage legitimately re-arms its
  timeout; rejecting the second arming would leave the stage holding its previous
  deadline and expiring early for a reason unreadable in the log.
- **Cancelling an unknown timer succeeds, and cancelling also un-fires.** The
  reducer cancels defensively — a stage that advanced before its timeout never
  armed one — so erroring would force a check-then-act race at every call site.
  And a timer cancelled in the same step in which it fired is removed from the
  delivery queue: otherwise the run would handle a timeout for a stage that had
  already advanced, which is exactly the double-outcome race that made
  `CancelTimer` a *control* effect in §10.3.

## 10.12 The fake executor is production code

`Fake` lives in `internal/exec`, not in a `_test.go` file, and that placement is
a decision rather than an accident: `--sim` is a user-facing feature, so if the
fake were test-only the shipped binary could not simulate anything, and users
would be left discovering how a blueprint behaves by paying for it.

What the fake does **not** do is decide anything. It reports that a turn
happened and lets `Decide` draw every conclusion. If the fake started concluding
that a submit means a stage advances, `--sim` would be predicting its own
behaviour rather than the reducer's, and would agree with `run` only by
coincidence.

Two smaller choices follow from the same reasoning:

- Simulated event ids are **deterministic** (`sim-0001`, `sim-0002`), not UUIDs.
  Ids appear in `caused_by` chains and therefore in the log; random ids would
  make two identical `--sim` runs differ on every line, and `run diff` useless
  exactly where it would be most useful.
- A simulated turn **costs money by default**. A free simulation can never reach
  a budget ceiling, so `budget.warning` and `budget.exceeded` would be dead code
  until a real run hit them.

## 10.13 Exact grants and workspace preaccept

Phase 4 does not turn an approval into a fresh model instruction. An `ask`
outcome persists the exact canonical call and continuation, and the approval
binds that immutable action. The active fenced worker re-folds the confirmed
prefix, then atomically appends `authorization.consumed` with the matching child
`exec.work_started`. The runner receives the call only after that batch commits.
A crash after the pair is started work, not an unused grant; recovery reconciles
a trustworthy receipt or records `unknown` rather than redispatching a
non-idempotent action.

Workspace resolution and availability are deliberately different steps. The
pure resolver derives one requirement per member; the native capability decision
then rejects any mode/profile combination the platform does not advertise. For
accepted combinations, external preparation happens while the run is still
unpublished and records ordered `prepared`, `started`, and `finished` evidence.
Only after every requirement is provisioner-verified are the frozen blueprint,
effective configuration, and `run.started` published. A failure invokes
ownership-checked cleanup and leaves no accepted run; a crash can re-enter the
provisioner, but path existence alone is never adoption evidence.

The production decision is intentionally narrower than internal implementation.
Windows currently advertises only `none`/`no-tools`. Since ADR-0017 Linux
additionally advertises `shared` paired exclusively with the read-only
`direct-files-read` profile: a read/grep combination passes preflight and the
session refuses mutating tools, while no writable file-using combination passes.
Native `copy`, `worktree`, and `contained-process` remain unavailable until one
production capability decision can guarantee the full source, lifecycle, file
and process contract.
