# Architecture decisions

Every file here records **one** decision: what was decided, which alternative
was discarded and **what breaks if somebody reverts it without reading this**.

These are not implementation docs. The implementation changes; these decisions
are the ones that cannot change without redesigning the system. If an ADR and
the code contradict each other, there is a bug in one of the two and somebody
has to decide which — not ignore the contradiction.

## Format

Short on purpose. Context, decision, consequences, and a **"how it is verified"**
section pointing at the test that enforces the decision. An ADR with no
associated test is an intention, and intentions do not survive a rushed
refactor.
