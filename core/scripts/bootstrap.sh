# Restore a working environment after a sandbox reset.
#
# This exists because the sandbox for this project has been reset repeatedly and
# loses two things every time: the Go toolchain (not preinstalled) and any commit
# that was never pushed. Rebuilding by hand cost a full turn of work once, so the
# recovery is a script instead of a memory exercise.
#
# Safe to run at any time. It never discards uncommitted work: if the tree is
# dirty it says so and stops, because silently resetting over a human's
# in-progress edit is worse than any reset this script recovers from.
#
# Usage:  ./scripts/bootstrap.sh [branch]     (default: genspark_ai_developer)
