// Package inbox is the human half of a run: the questions an agent asked, and
// the answers that unblock it.
//
// # There is no inbox database, and that is the design
//
// The obvious shape for this package is a store: a directory of question files,
// created when an agent asks and deleted when a human answers. It is not built
// that way, and the reason is the one property this project sells.
//
// A question already exists in the log. `applyToolDenied` mints the id, records
// the item in State, and returns an AskHuman effect; the effect runner appends
// the resulting inbox.created; and kernel.Fold rebuilds State.Inbox from those
// events on every read. So the question ALREADY outlives the process, and it
// does so in the one artefact that is append-only and replayable.
//
// A second copy on disk could only make things worse. Two records of one
// question can disagree, and the moment they do there is no rule for which one
// wins: the file says answered and the log says waiting, or the reverse, and
// `run why` and `arxi inbox` start telling the user different stories about the
// same run. That is precisely the failure ADR-0002 exists to prevent -- if the
// snapshot and the log disagree, the log wins -- and the cheapest way to honour
// it is to have nothing that can disagree.
//
// So this package READS the log and folds it. Listing is a fold. Answering is an
// append. There is no third thing to keep in sync.
//
// # Why the reader does not use logstore.Open
//
// logstore.Open acquires the writer lock and holds it for the lifetime of the
// Store, because seq assignment has to be indivisible. `arxi inbox` is a read
// performed by a human, usually while a run is sitting there blocked -- which is
// exactly when another process owns that lock.
//
// A reader that took the writer lock would therefore fail precisely in the
// situation it was built for, and the error would be about locking rather than
// about the run. So List reads the events file directly and folds them. It
// cannot corrupt anything, because it never writes; and reading a log that is
// being appended to can only miss the newest entries, which for a question a
// human is about to answer is a stale list, not a wrong one.
//
// Answer DOES take the lock, because it appends.
