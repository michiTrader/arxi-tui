// Package eval loads evaluation suites and compares evaluation runs.
//
// §20.11's premise: "prompt changes get judged by anecdote unless something
// measures them". This package is the measuring part, and it is separated from
// the running part for the same reason internal/trigger is separated from
// internal/trigstore — a suite that is wrong is wrong before anything executes,
// and 20 runs is an expensive place to discover a typo.
//
// # What eval gets for free, and what it does not
//
// The registry comment says "eval comes for free from the pure reducer: it is
// the same fold over fixed cases", and that is true of the EXECUTION. It is not
// true of the measurement, which is where the mistakes live:
//
//   - A pass rate computed over a suite that did not finish is a number with no
//     meaning, and there are two ways to get it wrong in opposite directions.
//   - A comparison between two runs of DIFFERENT case sets reads as a quality
//     delta when it is a change of question.
//
// Both are handled here, and both are the reason this is a package and not a
// pair of helpers in cmd/arxi.
//
// # The limitation this package does not hide
//
// One sample per case measures the sampler as much as the prompt. Model output
// varies between identical invocations, so a case that passes at 0.6
// probability contributes a coin flip to the pass rate, and a 20-case suite
// with no repetition can move ±0.15 between runs of the SAME prompt. That is
// the size of the improvement §20.11's example celebrates.
//
// There is no `repeat:` key yet, and adding an unused one would be worse than
// its absence — a field the runner ignores is a promise the file appears to
// make. What exists instead is this paragraph, and a `compare` that refuses to
// report a delta it cannot attribute. Whoever builds the runner should read
// this first.
