// spec and the code moved together; four other documents kept asserting the old
// fact for a full release cycle, because nothing failed when they disagreed.
// docs/adr/README.md says an ADR and the code contradicting each other is a bug
// in one of the two — this test is what makes that bug loud.

// instead of hardcoding profile names: a list here would be a third copy that
// agrees with itself while the code moves underneath it. What is asserted is
// the relationship — if Linux advertises the read-only profile, no document may
