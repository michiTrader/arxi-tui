// Action is a parsed `--then` value: what the trigger does when it fires.
//
// THE DECISION HERE IS THAT THERE IS NO ACTION VOCABULARY.
//
// `--then` was declared as "run:|emit:|notify:", three prefixes naming a set of
// things a trigger can do. That is a second surface, and it had already drifted
// before a line of trigger code existed: `notify` is not a command in this
// system, has no entry in the registry, and nothing anywhere says what it would
// send or to whom. Meanwhile §20.10's own example writes
//
//	--then "run start security-team 'audit dependencies for new CVEs'"
//
// with no prefix at all, because `run start` is simply what the user wants to
// happen. The document was right and the parameter description was the copy
// nobody updated.
//
// So `--then` is a command path from internal/surface, followed by its
// arguments. `run start`, `event emit`, `run cancel` — every capability the
// system has, with no per-action plumbing and nothing to keep in sync. A verb
// added to the registry is triggerable the same day; a verb renamed cannot leave
// a stale prefix behind, because there are no prefixes.
type Action struct {
	Raw  string   // what the user typed, echoed by `trigger show`
	Path []string // the registry path: {"run","start"}
	Args []string // everything after it, already split
}

// CLI renders the action the way the user would type it.
func (a Action) CLI() string {
	return strings.TrimSpace(strings.Join(a.Path, " ") + " " + strings.Join(a.Args, " "))
}

// ParseAction parses a `--then` value against the declared surface.
//
// Two things are checked, and the second is the one that matters.
//
// First, the command must exist. A trigger naming a verb nothing implements is
// stored, listed as active, and fails at 3am with nobody reading stderr.
//
// Second, the command must be something a NON-HUMAN may invoke, which is exactly
// Kind&AgentTool. A trigger fires unattended by definition, so a trigger is not
// a human, and the thirteen commands withheld from agents (§20.12) are withheld
// for reasons that apply here identically or more strongly:
//
//   - `inbox approve` is the human's side of the conversation. A trigger that
//     approves inbox items turns every `ToolPolicy: ask` in the system into
//     `allow` — on a schedule, while nobody is watching.
//   - `provider add`, `model enable`, `agent tool policy` are operator
//     decisions about credentials, spend and permission.
//   - `run attach` blocks waiting for output nobody is reading.
//   - `serve` and `design` are an operator's socket and an interactive editor.
//
// `trigger create` is itself `ToolPolicy: ask`, so an agent can propose one with
// a human approval. Without this check that approval would be worth much less
// than it looks: approving "create a trigger" would be approving whatever the
// trigger's --then contains, and a human reading a diff is not going to
// reconstruct §20.12's table from memory to notice that one line hands an agent
// the inbox.
//
// The set is DERIVED from the Kind flags, never listed here. A hand-written list
// of forbidden verbs is how the description this function replaces went stale.
