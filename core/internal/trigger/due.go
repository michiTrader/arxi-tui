// This file answers one question: given a stored trigger and an instant, should
// it fire right now, and how many times?
//
// It is separate from record.go because Next and Missed answer questions an
// operator asks ("when will this run", "what did I lose while the laptop was
// shut") and Due answers the question the SCHEDULER asks, which is not the same
// question and has different edge cases. Keeping it here, in the pure package,
// is what makes 3am on a leap day a test rather than a wait.
//
// The scheduler that calls this owns a clock, a store and a subprocess. None of
// those appear below. Every answer is a function of the record and the `now` it
// is handed, so the interesting cases -- a trigger due for the first time, a
// four-day outage, a schedule that has run out of future -- are ordinary table
// entries.

// Decision is what the scheduler should do about one trigger at one instant.
//
// Runs is separate from ShouldFire because the two are genuinely different
// facts, and collapsing them into an int with 0 meaning "no" would lose the
// reason. A trigger can be not-firing because it is paused, because it is
// event-driven, because nothing is due yet, or because firings WERE missed and
// the policy says to drop them -- and the last of those is the only one an
// operator needs to be told about. A bare 0 cannot say which happened.
type Decision struct {
	// ShouldFire is whether to invoke the action at all.
	ShouldFire bool

	// Runs is how many invocations are owed. It is 1 in the ordinary case and
	// greater only under --on-missed=run-all after an outage.
	//
	// It is not a count of "times the schedule elapsed": under `skip` and
	// `run-once` the schedule may have elapsed forty times and this is still
	// 1 or 0. It is what the POLICY says to actually do.
	Runs int

	// Missed is how many scheduled firings elapsed unattended, whatever the
	// policy then decided to do about them.
	//
	// Reported even when the policy drops them, and that is the point: "skipped
	// 4 nightly audits" is the single most important sentence this system can
	// say to somebody who thinks their automation is healthy. A scheduler that
	// silently honoured `skip` would be indistinguishable from one that was
	// never down.
	Missed int

	// MissedCapped says the real number is at least Missed, not exactly Missed.
	MissedCapped bool

	// Slots are the exact nominal UTC instants selected for execution. Their order
	// is execution order, which is ascending for run-all. A scheduler wake time
	// must never substitute for one of these values: occurrence identity depends
	// on the slot remaining stable across late and duplicate ticks.
	Slots []time.Time

	// SkippedSlots are exact nominal UTC instants the on-missed policy consciously
	// discarded. They remain separate from Slots because durable coordination must
	// record the skip without accidentally admitting work for it.
	SkippedSlots []time.Time

	// Why is a short reason, always set, in the operator's vocabulary rather
	// than the code's.
	//
	// Always set INCLUDING when firing, because the log line "fired
	// nightly-audit" is worth less than "fired nightly-audit (due at
	// 03:00Z)" when the question later is whether it fired at the right time.
	Why string
}

// Due decides whether a trigger fires at now.
//
// The order of the checks below is the design, and each one is a different
// question that must be asked before the next is meaningful:
//
//  1. PAUSED. Asked first because a paused trigger's schedule is still valid
//     and still says 03:00 -- so every later check would happily conclude "due".
//     Pause is the operation §20.10 chose over delete precisely so that the
//     configuration survives, which means the scheduler is the thing that has to
//     honour it.
//  2. PARSEABLE. A trigger that no longer parses must not be silently skipped.
//     It is returned as an error so the caller reports it: a schedule the
//     current build would refuse to create, still sitting on disk, is a trigger
//     the operator believes is running.
//  3. TIME-BASED. An event trigger has no due-ness in the clock. Nobody knows
//     when a webhook is next called, and asking a cron parser is meaningless.
//  4. FIRST FIRING. Handled explicitly, because Missed deliberately returns 0
//     for a never-fired trigger and it is right to: a daily trigger created a
//     month ago has not "missed" thirty runs. But that means due-ness for the
//     very first firing cannot come from Missed, and a scheduler built only on
//     Missed would never fire anything for the first time. That is the bug this
//     function exists to make impossible, and it was found by probing Missed
//     rather than by reading it.
//  5. MISSED, then the policy.
