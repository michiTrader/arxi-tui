// The overlap policy: what to do when a firing comes due and the previous one
// has not finished.
//
// This is the second half of the scheduler's decision and it lives here, beside
// Due, for the reason Due lives here at all: it is a function of the record, the
// dueness, and a count. No clock, no store, no subprocess. `cancel-previous` is
// the policy most likely to be got wrong and it is the one that costs the most
// when it is — it kills work that has already been paid for — so it wants to be
// a table entry, not something exercised by starting goroutines and hoping.
//
// Due deliberately does not do this. Due answers "is this slot due" from the
// record alone; whether anything is currently RUNNING is knowledge only the
// process holding the subprocesses has. Folding the two together would mean Due
// could not be tested without inventing a fleet of fake executions, and would
// mean `trigger list` — which wants dueness and has no runner — could not call
// it.
//
// # There is no queue data structure
//
// `overlap: queue` was the policy that looked like it needed one. It does not,
// and seeing why is what makes the rest of this file small.
//
// Dueness is DERIVED from LastFiredAt on every tick (ADR-0002: nothing is
// stored that can be computed). So a firing that is not started, and whose
// LastFiredAt is therefore not advanced, is still due on the next tick. The
// store IS the queue, durably, across restarts, with no second copy of the
// truth to reconcile. An in-memory queue would add one, and would lose it on
// the first crash while the record on disk still said the slot was unattended.
//
// That is also what makes `skip` and `queue` genuinely different rather than
// two spellings of "do not start it now". Under `queue` the slot stays
// unattended and comes back. Under `skip` it must be FORGOTTEN, which means
// something has to record that it was consciously passed over — hence
// Admission.Consume below, and hence this being a three-outcome decision rather
// than a boolean.

// Admission is what the scheduler should do about a firing, once both the
// schedule and the overlap policy have had their say.
//
// Three separate fields rather than one enum, because they are independently
// true: `cancel-previous` both cancels AND starts, and a policy that only
// cancelled would be a policy that silently stops a trigger from ever
// completing anything.
type Admission struct {
	// Start is how many executions to begin now. 0 means none.
	Start int

	// Cancel means stop the in-flight execution first. Only ever set when
	// Start > 0: cancelling in order to start nothing is not a policy anybody
	// asked for, and it is the shape a bug would take.
	Cancel bool

	// Consume means "advance LastFiredAt even though nothing ran".
	//
	// This is how a slot is deliberately forgotten. Without it, `skip` and
	// `queue` would behave identically — both decline to start — and the
	// skipped firing would come back on the next tick, forever, which is the
	// definition of not having skipped it.
	//
	// The scheduler records LastStatus alongside, so the reason survives into
	// `trigger list`. A slot dropped with no trace is a slot the operator will
	// assume ran.
	Consume bool

	// Why is always set, for firing and for declining alike, and it is the
	// field that makes an unattended system answerable. See Decision.Why.

// derived from it afterwards would be fiction.
