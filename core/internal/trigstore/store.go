// Package trigstore persists triggers on disk.
//
// It is a separate package from internal/trigger for the same reason logstore
// is separate from kernel: internal/trigger's own architecture test forbids it
// from importing os, because a schedule parser that reads the filesystem is a
// schedule parser that cannot be tested without one. So the rule is the same
// one the kernel follows — the pure package decides what a trigger IS, and a
// package one layer out decides where the bytes live.
//
// The alternative was to put these functions in cmd/arxi next to the flag
// parsing. That fails the first time anything other than the CLI needs to read
// a trigger, which is the scheduler — the very next step. Persistence reachable
// only from a main package is persistence that gets copy-pasted.
//
// # One file per trigger
//
// Triggers are stored as triggers/<name>.json, not as rows in one index file.
// An index means `trigger pause nightly-audit` rewrites the record of every
// other trigger too: a crash mid-write loses schedules that had nothing to do
// with the command, and two processes writing different triggers lose one of
// them entirely. With one file per trigger, the blast radius of any write is
// the trigger named in the command.
//
// # There is no Delete
//
// The surface declares create, list, show and pause, and pause exists BECAUSE
// delete does not (docs/design/20-use-cases.md §20.10: a deleted trigger takes
// its history with it, and the reason it was stopped is usually the thing you
// want to read later). A store method with no caller is the one that acquires a
// caller by accident, so it is not written.
