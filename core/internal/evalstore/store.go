// Package evalstore persists evaluation runs on disk.
//
// It is a separate package from internal/eval for the reason logstore is
// separate from kernel and trigstore from trigger: internal/eval's own
// architecture test forbids it from importing database/sql, and forbids the
// clock and the network besides. A suite loader that reaches the filesystem for
// anything other than reading the suite is one that cannot be tested without
// one. So the pure package decides what a run IS and whether it is meaningful,
// and this package decides where the bytes live.
//
// # Why a store at all
//
// `eval run` reported its numbers and exited, which made `eval compare`
// undeliverable: comparing needs two runs, and there was nowhere for the first
// one to wait. That is the whole motivation, and it is worth stating because it
// bounds what this package should do. It is not a general run database. It is
// the place `compare` reads from.
//
// # One file per run, and runs are never updated
//
// evals/<id>.json, written once. This differs from trigstore in a way that
// matters: a trigger has a Save because pausing one is an edit to a living
// thing, whereas a run is a measurement that has already happened. There is no
// Save here and no overwrite -- Put refuses an id that exists.
//
// That refusal is the point. A run is evidence, and `compare` exists so a
// decision can be defended by pointing at two of them. Silently replacing e1
// with a different e1 would make yesterday's quoted table unreproducible while
// every path and id in it still resolved, which is the worst available failure:
// the citation keeps working and stops being true.
//
// # There is no Delete, and no pruning
//
// Runs accumulate. That is a real cost -- a suite run nightly leaves 365 files
// a year -- and it is accepted rather than solved, because the alternatives are
// worse in ways that are not obvious until they bite. A retention policy
// deletes the baseline somebody is about to cite. A "keep the last N" rule
// deletes the interesting run, since the interesting run is old by definition:
// it is the one from before the change. And the files are small.
//
// If pruning is ever needed it belongs in a command a human runs and reads the
// output of, not in a store method that a writer can call by accident.

// The alternative was a finer clock. Nanoseconds would collide less, but they
