// there are two implementations of "is it 3am yet", one of which is tested with
// literal timestamps and one of which is tested by waiting.
//
// The specific drift this prevents is a plausible-looking convenience. A
// scheduler holding a Record and a `now` is one line away from
// `r.Next(now).Before(now)` inlined into the loop as a cheap pre-filter, or a
// `strings.HasPrefix(r.On, "cron:")` special case to skip records it thinks
// cannot be due. Both would work on the day they were written and both would
// then disagree with Due about a leap day, a paused trigger, or a schedule with
