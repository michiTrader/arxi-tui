// Package toolstore persists per-agent tool policy overrides on disk.
//
// Separate from internal/tool for the reason every pure package in this tree has
// a store beside it: internal/tool is forbidden by arch_test from touching os,
// so the rule about what an agent may do can be tested without a filesystem.
// This package decides only where the bytes live.
//
// # What an override is, and what it is not
//
// tool.Resolve already had a place for these:
//
//	a tool not granted to the agent  -> deny
//	an override, if one exists       -> whatever it says
//	a granted tool that mutates      -> ask
//	a granted tool that reads        -> allow
//
// The override slot existed and was always nil. `run start` built its executor
// with ToolPolicy unset, so the second line of that table was unreachable and
// the only way to stop being asked about a tool was to stop granting it. This
// package fills the slot.
//
// An override does NOT grant a tool. tool.Resolve checks the grant list first
// and returns deny for anything the agent was never given, so `--allow bash` on
// an agent without bash changes nothing. That ordering is deliberate and is not
// this package's to relax: an override that could grant would make the
// blueprint's `tools:` list decorative, and the blueprint is the thing under
// review.
//
// # Why a store and not an event
//
// Every other durable decision in this project is an event in a run's log, and
// this one is not. The reason is in the surface: `agent tool policy` takes an
// --agent and no --run. It is an operator decision about an agent across runs,
// not a fact about one run, and writing it into one run's log would mean the
// next run could not see it.
//
// The sharper reason is the frozen blueprint. `run start` freezes
// blueprint.snapshot.yaml so a run is judged by rules that cannot change
// underneath it. Overrides sit OUTSIDE that snapshot on purpose: they are the
// operator's standing answer to "stop asking me about this", and they are read
// fresh at the start of every run rather than baked into one.
//
// The cost of that choice is real and is documented rather than hidden: a policy
// change does not reach a run that is already going. See Load.
//
// # One file per agent
//
// policies/<agent>.json, not one index. Same reasoning as trigstore and
// modelstore: `agent tool policy --agent backend --allow bash` rewrites the
// record of the agent it names and nothing else, so a crash mid-write cannot
// lose the policy of an agent the command never mentioned.
//
// # Not in the home directory
//
// Policies sit beside runs/, triggers/ and providers/ in the working directory,
// following the same trade-off those made. A home-directory store would make an
// override follow the user between projects, so `--allow bash` typed once for a
// throwaway experiment would silently widen an agent's reach in every
// repository afterwards. That is precisely the kind of authorization nobody
// remembers granting.
