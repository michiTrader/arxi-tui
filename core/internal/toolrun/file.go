// maxReadBytes caps what a read tool may pull into memory.

// The number is not about disk or RAM, it is about the log. Tool output becomes
// an event, and an event becomes a line in the run log that somebody replays
// later. A member that reads a 900 MB file produces a run nobody can open, so
// the artefact this project exists to make readable is destroyed by a tool that
// technically succeeded.

// access is not write, before any path is touched.

// This is deliberately redundant with preflight: preflight refuses the
// configuration at acceptance time, this refuses the dispatch at execution
// time. A future code path that grants a mutating tool to a read-only session
// fails closed at the point of use instead of silently succeeding because
// nothing checked. The zero value of fileAccess is FileAccessNone, so an
// unplumbed access refuses writes too: a missing value is not a promise of
// write, and making it one would return read-only-ness to accident status
// (ADR-0017).
