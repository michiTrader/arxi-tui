// maxMatches caps how many hits one grep may report.
//
// The same reason as maxReadBytes, arrived at from the other end: a grep for "e"
// across a source tree matches nearly every line, and tool output becomes an
// event in the run log. The cap is on MATCHES rather than bytes because that is
// the number the model is reasoning about -- "200 matches, showing the first 50"
// is a fact it can act on, where "truncated at 256 KiB" tells it nothing about
// how much it did not see.
const maxMatches = 200

// maxGrepFiles caps how many files one grep may open.
//
// A separate limit from maxMatches, because the failure it prevents is different:
// a pattern that matches nothing still walks the whole tree, so a cap on matches
// alone would let a no-match grep spend unbounded time in a workspace somebody
// unpacked a dependency tree into.

// grepResult is one matching line.
type grepMatch struct {
	Path string
	Line int

// Grep searches the workspace for a regular expression.
//
// # Regexp and not a substring
//
// `grep` is a name with a meaning, and a model that has been told it has grep
// will send it `func \w+\(` sooner or later. Accepting the pattern as a literal
// substring would find nothing, report success, and teach the model that the
// file does not contain what it does contain -- a wrong answer delivered as a
// confident one, which is the failure mode this whole package's error messages
// are written to avoid.
//
// The pattern is compiled BEFORE the walk, so a bad pattern is a refusal rather
// than an empty result. `regexp` is Go's RE2: it has no backreferences and no
// lookahead, and cannot backtrack exponentially. That last property is why no
// timeout is needed here, unlike bash.
//
// # The walk respects the boundary the same way a read does
//
// Every candidate goes through ReadFile, which means Resolve plus openNoFollow,
// which means a symlink pointing out of the workspace is refused at the open
// rather than followed. That is the control, and it is refused in the kernel:
// measured, ReadFile on a link to a file outside says "refused in the kernel by
// O_NOFOLLOW", and a path THROUGH a linked directory is refused by Resolve
// before any open happens.
//
// The walk also skips symlinked entries, and an earlier version of this comment
// claimed that skip was what kept a link to / from putting the filesystem in
// scope. It is not, and the claim was found by breaking the skip and watching
// the test that guards the boundary still pass. Two measurements say why:
// filepath.WalkDir does not descend into symlinked directories at all (it
// yields the link as one non-directory entry), and the entry it does yield is
// refused by ReadFile. The skip is therefore an optimisation -- it avoids an
// open that would fail -- and the boundary is held by controls that have their
// own tests in file_test.go and workspace_test.go. Documenting it as the
// control would have pointed the next reader at the wrong line to be careful
// with.
//
// Binary files are skipped rather than matched. A NUL byte in the first 8 KiB is
// the test, which is what git uses, and the reason is the log again: a match
// inside a compiled object dumps bytes nobody can read into the run history.

// Edit replaces occurrences of old with new in a file inside the workspace.

// # Why not "write the whole file"

// being the operation that does NOT require the model to reproduce the parts it
// is not changing -- which is where a whole-file write goes wrong: the model
// re-emits 300 lines from memory to change one, and quietly drops a line it
// never looked at. An edit that names what it is replacing cannot do that.
//
// # A replacement that matches nothing is an ERROR
//
// This is the decision in this function worth arguing about, and it goes against
// the shape of the rest of the file tools, which are permissive about
// vocabulary. It is an error because the alternative is silent success on a
// no-op: the model believes the file now says something it does not, continues
// on that belief, and the run's later steps are all built on it. A tool that
// reports "edited" without editing is the same class of defect as a grep that
// reports no matches in a file full of them.
//
// # An ambiguous replacement is also an error
//
// If old appears more than once and the caller did not say `all`, the edit is
// refused rather than applied to the first hit. "The first one" is a position in
// a file the model cannot see, so which occurrence it got would be luck, and a
// tool that silently picks one is a tool whose result nobody can predict. The
