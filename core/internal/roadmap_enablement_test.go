// Enumerated rather than inferred, for the reason ADR-0023 gives about receipt
// kinds: a check that looks only for the fields it knows cannot tell a missing
// claim from a claim spelled differently. This was measured, not supposed —
// renaming "Enables" to "Unblocks" in one ADR made that ADR invisible to the
// enablement check above and the whole test passed, because a header nobody
// matches is indistinguishable from a header nobody wrote.
//
// So an unrecognized field fails closed. The cost is that adding a legitimate
// new field requires editing this set, which is the intended trade: the edit is
// a deliberate decision recorded in one place, whereas the silence it replaces
// was undetectable.
//
// The set is meant to be the measured vocabulary of the corpus, and
// TestHeaderVocabularyMatchesTheCorpus derives that vocabulary on every run and
// asserts this map equals it exactly. Frozen per-field counts are deliberately
// not written here: an earlier version of this comment stated "all 25 records
// ... Depends on in 16, Enables in 6" and every figure was wrong even when it
// was typed and drifted further with each record added (ADR-0030). A count kept
// by hand drifts precisely because nothing fails when it does, so it is derived
// below rather than narrated here.

// TestEveryEnablingDecisionIsCitedByThePhaseItEnables closes the gap between an
// ADR claiming to unblock a phase and that phase's status narration admitting
// it exists.
//
// This is the defect ADR-0026 was written for, and it is the third instance of
// one shape. ADR-0024 found a guard with no caller; ADR-0025 found an assertion
// with no subject; this is a narration with no source. In each case a decision
// was published and something that was supposed to carry it did not, and the
// suite stayed green because nothing connected the two.
//
// Concretely: ADR-0025 corrected the memory channel in the two assemblers that
// never adopted it, declared "Enables: Phase 7", and the roadmap's Phase 7
// status went on listing five settled prerequisites and citing ADR-0020 through
// ADR-0024. A reader planning the store from that document would have read
// "the preparer presents it as a user-role message" and concluded the channel
// was a solved, single-site property — which is the precise belief ADR-0025
// exists to refute, and the belief under which the defect survived four ADRs.
//
// The direction of the check is the point. It does not require the roadmap to
// discuss unbuilt work, and it does not judge whether a prerequisite is truly
// settled — the exit evidence in each phase is for that. It requires only that
// a phase cannot silently omit a decision that named it. An omission reads as
// absence of the decision, and absence is what gets designed around.
//
