// document" was never quite true. What that test reads is §20.12: the tool split,
// and the one sentence stating it. The document opens four hundred lines earlier
// with `arxi surface` lists the N declared capabilities, and nothing read that,
// so it sat at 46 through four capabilities — in the file whose own §20.13 says

// says nothing about the rest of the file, and the sentence a reader meets first
