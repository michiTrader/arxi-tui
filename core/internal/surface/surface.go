// shortFlags maps a parameter name to its one-letter form, ONCE, for the whole

//
// The obvious implementations are both worse, and for the same reason.
//
// Per-command aliases (`run start` declaring `-p` for prompt, `run prompt`
// declaring `-p` for something else) would be a second surface. It is the same
// mistake a hand-kept list of protocol types would have been: the registry says
// one thing, a table somewhere else says another, and the two drift the first
// time somebody adds a parameter and updates only one of them. Worse here than
// there, because the drift is invisible — `-p` keeps working, it just stops
// meaning what the reader learned it meant.
//
// Deriving the letter from the first character of the name is worse still. The
// surface has `budget` and `base-url`, `to` and `tools` and `text` and `type`
// and `ttl`, `on` and `on-busy` and `on-missed` and `overlap`. Auto-assignment
// hands the letter to whichever entry the registry happens to list first, so
// `-b 5` means a spend ceiling today and a provider URL after somebody sorts
// the file alphabetically. A short flag whose meaning depends on the order of a
// slice is worse than no short flag at all: the script that used it does not
// fail, it silently does something else with the number.
//
// So: an explicit, global, collision-free assignment, verified by
// TestShortFlagsAreUnambiguous. Only names that are frequent or long enough to
// be worth typing get one. A parameter with no entry has no short form, which
// is the correct default — a letter nobody can guess is not a shorthand, it is

// A note on POSITIONAL parameters, because the first version of this map got it
// wrong and the mistake was instructive.
//
// -p (prompt), -f (path) and -r (run) abbreviate parameters declared with pos(),
// whose identity is arguably their position. The first attempt therefore refused
// short flags for positionals — and that deleted exactly the useful cases: -r
// reaches seventeen commands, and -p and -f are the two a person types most.
//
// So the rule is the other way round: a declared parameter is ALWAYS reachable
// by name, and the position is a convenience layered on top. `--actor` is not a
// spelling invented for the CLI's benefit; it is the name this registry already
// publishes to the tool schema and the protocol, so accepting it costs nothing
// and refusing it would be the surface contradicting itself.
//
// What that rule creates is an obligation on every parser: if the registry
// declares a parameter, --<name> must reach it. That is enforced by
// TestEveryShortFlagReachesItsParameter in cmd/arxi rather than trusted, because
// the failure mode is silent — expandShort produces a long flag the parser drops,
// and the command runs with a value the user believes they supplied.

// Short returns the one-letter flag for a parameter, or "" if it has none.
//
// It takes the CLI spelling (`if-seq`, not `if_seq`) because that is the form
// the user types and the form Params carries. The wire has no short flags at
// all: a machine has no fingers to save, and `{"b": 5}` in a log is a puzzle
