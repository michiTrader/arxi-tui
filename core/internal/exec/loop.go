// Timekeeper is how the run loop obtains the passage of time.
//
// This interface is the ONE place where a real run and a simulation differ.
// Everything else in the loop is identical, and that is the property that makes
// `--sim` worth trusting: if the two shared no code, a simulation would be
// predicting its own behaviour rather than the run's, and would agree with `run`
// only by coincidence.
//
// It is a separate seam from Clock because the two answer different questions.
// Clock is the WRITE side, driven by the reducer's effects: arm this deadline,
// cancel that one. Timekeeper is the READ side, driven by the loop: has anything
// fired, how long until something does, make time pass. Merging them would force
// every implementation to supply both, and the Fake executor used by unit tests
// has no business knowing how to sleep.
//
// Advance is the method that separates the two worlds. A simulation JUMPS to the
// next deadline, so a thirty-minute stage timeout is exercised in microseconds; a
// real run WAITS for it. Both then read the fired ids through the same Due, and
// the reducer cannot tell which one it is talking to.

	//     executing one event appends several: those appends sit above the last
	//     event the loop actually decided and would be skipped forever.
