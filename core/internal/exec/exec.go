// Package exec runs the effects that the reducer described.

// implementations that drift apart:
//
//	run     = kernel.Fold + real Executor    + real Log
//	--sim   = kernel.Fold + Fake Executor    + real Log + VirtualClock
//	replay  = kernel.Fold + no Executor at all
//
// If this package ever starts making decisions (choosing which agent to wake,
// deciding a stage advanced), that equivalence dies: `--sim` would stop
// predicting `run`, and the simulation would become a lie that is worse than
// having no simulation.

// the log. And because a disagreeing cache is read in preference to the log,
// that would be a wrong answer served fast. So the state is re-folded from the
// log, which is by definition consistent with it.

// cache write failed would invert ADR-0002 and make an optimization mandatory.

// This is the decision that keeps --sim worth having. Replay reads the log, so

// way. But if the append order followed whichever provider answered first, then
// two --sim runs over identical input would produce different logs, and the
// simulation could no longer be used to predict or to diff. Indexing the
// results costs one slice and buys determinism.
//
// The other decision is that a failing effect does not discard its siblings.
// By the time one SpawnTurn errors, the other two have already spent real money
// and the tool call has already touched the filesystem. Dropping their events
// would leave the log describing a world that does not exist, which is the one

// SpawnTurn that returns an error without one leaves that marker set for the rest
// of the run, so Busy() stays true, quiescence can never fire again and a genuine
// stall later on goes unreported. Result.Errs cannot close it: Errs belongs to one
// step and dies with the process, while the state is rebuilt by folding the log,
// so anything the state must survive has to BE in the log. agent.failed was
// already declared, catalogued (spec/events.md) and reduced to MemberFailed

// docs/design/10-execution.md said it was waiting for.

// events at all". A turn that wrote agent.activated and then died is the same
// disease -- a member the reducer believes is working, with a turn that can never
// close -- and a refusal that legitimately returns llm.response{ok:false} plus
// turn_done has already closed its own turn and must NOT be marked failed, since
// MemberFailed takes the member out of every later stage.
//
// Only SpawnTurn. A CallTool or AskHuman that fails strands nothing in the state:
// the member is left where it was, and the reducer's own timers and blocks still
// apply. Inventing an event for those would be writing a guess into the log,
