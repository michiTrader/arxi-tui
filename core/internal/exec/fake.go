// Fake is the executor that `--sim` and every test use instead of calling a
// provider.
//
// It is production code and not test-only code, and that placement is the
// point: `--sim` is a user-facing feature, so if the fake lived in a _test.go
// file the shipped binary could not simulate anything. Users would then be left
// discovering how a blueprint behaves by paying for it.
//
// What the fake does NOT do is decide anything. It answers "the turn happened"
// and lets kernel.Decide draw every conclusion. If the fake started deciding
// that a submit means a stage advances, --sim would be predicting its own
// behaviour rather than the reducer's, and would agree with `run` only by
// coincidence.

	// FailTools maps tool name to a DOMAIN failure. The result is an event of

	// error: the tool ran and refused, and that is a fact the log must keep.

	// with no event. This is the different, worse case: nothing can be said
	// about what happened, so nothing is written.
	BreakTools map[string]error

	// BreakTurns maps agent name to a TRANSPORT failure when its turn is opened:
	// the provider was unreachable, rate-limited or returned a 500, so the turn
	// never happened and no event describes it.
	//
	// This is the most ordinary failure a real run meets and it was the one the
	// simulation could not produce. BreakTools covers a tool that could not be
	// reached, but a turn is where the money and the coordination live, and the
	// two fail differently: a broken tool leaves a member mid-turn that can still
	// finish, while a broken turn leaves a member the reducer believes is
	// thinking and that will never emit agent.turn_done. Without a way to
	// simulate it, the loop's promise not to abandon a run over one failed effect
	// was only ever documented, never exercised.

	// HumanReplies maps inbox kind to an immediate answer. Empty means the

	// impossible to test what a run does while waiting.

	// AskTools maps tool name to the policy that stops it, normally "ask". The
	// call produces tool.call_denied instead of running, which is how a
	// simulation reaches the human-in-the-loop path at all.
	//
	// It is separate from FailTools because a denial is not a failure. A failed
	// tool is a fact the agent reacts to and the run continues; a denied one
	// suspends the member until a person answers, and those two produce entirely
	// different runs. Without this knob the approval scenario the design
	// specifies was unreachable in --sim, so the state a run spends the most
	// wall-clock time in -- waiting for a human -- could only ever be tested by
	// hand-appending the event, which tests the reducer and not the path.
	AskTools map[string]string

	// DenyTurnTool makes a member's simulated turn call a tool before finishing,
	// keyed by agent name. Without it, a simulated turn calls nothing, so a
	// policy=ask denial could never arise DURING a turn -- which is the only
	// moment it arises in a real run, since an agent requests a tool while
	// thinking. Appending the denial from outside instead puts it before the
	// stage that requested it was even entered, a shape no provider produces.
	DenyTurnTool map[string]string

	// Submits decides whether a simulated turn ends by submitting to its stage.
	// True in NewFake, and that default is what makes --sim able to reach the end
	// of a staged blueprint at all.
	//
	// A real agent submits by calling a tool during its turn, so the event exists
	// in a real run and the reducer advances stages on nothing else. A fake that
	// never emitted it left every staged blueprint stuck in stage one: the turns
	// happened, the quorum was never met, and --sim reported a perfectly good
	// blueprint as silent. That is worse than not simulating, because it teaches
	// the user to distrust a correct answer.
	//
	// It is a knob rather than a constant because the run that does NOT submit is
	// what quiescence detection has to catch, and that path needs simulating too.
	// Emitting the event is not a decision: whether a submit advances the stage
	// remains entirely the reducer's call, which is what keeps --sim predicting
	// `run` rather than predicting itself.
