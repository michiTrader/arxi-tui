// running against the ceiling it had already exhausted, spent one more time,

//
//	after exceeded:            status=blocked budget=1.00
//	after unpaused(budget 10): status=running budget=1.00

// The command a document recommends and a reducer ignores is worse than a
// missing feature, because the person following the advice concludes the block
// is unfixable rather than that the remedy is unimplemented.

// tightening a budget -- a resume that quietly narrowed the headroom would be a

// ceiling" here: an unpause carrying no budget is the ordinary case (§20.6's

// leaves this arm deciding the case it cannot: two agents' tool calls landing in
// one batch, where the only answer that keeps the invariant is the first.

// it needs two more minutes rather than ten is information, not a mistake.
