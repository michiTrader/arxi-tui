// Effect is something the reducer wants to happen in the real world. The
// reducer does not do it: it describes it. The executor carries it out and
// returns the result as a new event.
//
// The interface has an unexported method (isEffect) so that it is sealed: no
// package outside kernel can add variants. This is Go's way of approximating a
// Rust enum, and the reason the approximation is acceptable is in ADR-0007:
// what Go does not give us in the compiler we give ourselves with
// TestEffectExhaustive, which fails if someone adds a variant and forgets to
// register it.
//
// Provenance is on the interface for the same reason Class is: a variant that
// forgets to answer does not compile. The alternative was a type switch in exec,
// and a type switch that misses a new variant does not fail loudly -- it writes
// that variant's events with no cause at all, which is the exact defect Cause
// exists to fix.

// EffectClass resolves the gap AI A flagged: if Decide returns []Effect, does
// the executor run them in order or in parallel?
//
// The answer cannot be "all in parallel" because Emit and SetTimer change what
// the rest of the system is going to see, nor "all in order" because then three
// agent turns that know nothing about each other get serialized and we lose the
// whole reason this tool exists.
//
// So they split into two classes: control first and in list order, independent
// afterwards and in parallel. The reducer orders the list before returning it
// (see orderEffects), so the executor only needs this rule: run the control
// prefix sequentially, then the rest concurrently.

// Cause is the provenance an effect hands to the events it produces: who caused
// them, which causal thread they belong to, and how deep in that thread they sit.
//
// It exists because the executor cannot work this out for itself. Runner.Run is
// handed a []Effect and nothing else, so by the time a turn's four events come
// back from a provider, the event that opened the turn is not in scope and never
// was. What that cost was measurable rather than theoretical: `arxi event trace`
// over a real run printed a chain of five events out of twenty-one, because the
// sixteen the executor minted arrived with caused_by empty, correlation_id empty
// and depth 0 -- and depth 0 also meant each of them cleared the depth brake in
// wakeWatchers as if it were a root cause.
//
// The reducer is the only place that holds both the effect and the event that
// decided it, so the reducer resolves the triple and the executor copies it.
// That is the argument AskHuman.ID already makes about inbox ids, and for the
// same reason: a field the reducer owns cannot come out differently on a second
// fold of the same log.
//
// The triple is RESOLVED, not raw. Depth is already the produced event's depth,
// and CorrelationID has already fallen back to the cause's own id when the cause
// carried none. No reader re-derives the rule, so no reader can derive it
// differently: causeOf (decide.go) computes it once, and derived() -- the other
// thing in the tree that writes these three fields -- goes through the same
// function.
