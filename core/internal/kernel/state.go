	// A member that submits mid-turn moves to MemberSubmitted, which is neither

	// COMMISSIONED, not activated, and the difference is a whole class of the same
	// bug. The turn a SpawnTurn effect describes is executed by the runner AFTER
	// the fold that decided it returns (internal/exec/loop.go: Decide then
	// Runner.Run), so between those two moments the turn exists in no event at

	// cannot reach its provider therefore has to append the second one

// THE SAME SUBTLETY, FROM THE OTHER SIDE: being idle is not enough either. The
// reducer never opens a turn merely because somebody is idle; every turn is
// opened by a CAUSE (a stage was entered, a watcher matched, a human injected a
// prompt, a queued cause drained). So an idle member with no pending cause is not
// waiting to work, it has finished working, and reporting it as runnable makes
// checkQuiescence conclude that something is still going to happen when nothing
// is.
//
// That hid the exact failure ADR-0004 is about, in a case no earlier test could
// reach: a member whose turn ends WITHOUT submitting returns to idle, so a stage
// whose rule needs everybody sat silent forever and no diagnosis was emitted at
// all. The run loop could only report it as "idle", which is indistinguishable
// from a run legitimately waiting on a human.

//
// MemberWaiting overrides it, and that exclusion is the point of the whole

// open turn and is spending nothing: the question could sit in the inbox for a

// ("waiting for approval of inbox-1") and make `run why` contradict itself,
// reporting the member as blocked and then as working two lines later.
