//     budget on llm.response (decide.go applyCost). A turn_done seen first would
//     let a run look finished and under budget while the money was already spent.

// CallTool enforces the policy, and refuses only what it cannot yet do safely.

// The permission half of the tool runner is real now; the execution half is not.
// That split is not a halfway measure, it is the useful order: two of the three
// policy outcomes are decisions rather than work, and they are exactly the two
// where getting it wrong is unrecoverable.
//
//	deny  -> tool.call_denied. A decision. Nothing runs, and the log records
//	         why, so `run why` can name the tool and the member.
//	ask   -> tool.call_denied with policy=ask, which the reducer turns into an
//	         inbox item and a blocked_ref (applyToolDenied). Per spec this is
//	         NOT an error: it is a question.
//	allow -> still refused, loudly, because running it needs a sandbox for
//	         `bash` and the workspace isolation the blueprint declares.
//
// Refusing an ALLOW is the honest answer. Returning a successful
// tool.call_completed would make the reducer advance a stage on the strength of
// work nobody did, and the log would record a result that never existed -- which
// is unrecoverable, because the log is what `run why` and every replay trust.
//
// Emitting the denial as an EVENT rather than returning an error is the point of
// doing this half first. A denial is a domain fact: it happened, it is the
// correct outcome, and the run should continue knowing it. Returning an error
// would abort the effect and leave no trace of the decision, so the one case
// where the policy did its job would look identical to a broken executor.
