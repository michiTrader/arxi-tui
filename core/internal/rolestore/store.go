// Package rolestore persists reusable role defaults on disk.
//
// # A role is a fragment of a member, not a document
//
// internal/agentstore renders an agent as a one-member blueprint, on the grounds
// that "an agent" and "a member of a blueprint" are the same noun. A role is not
// the same noun as either. It carries a tool grant and the advisory trait and
// nothing else: no member name, no model, no stage, no objective. There is
// nothing to run, so there is nothing for blueprint.Load to check and no
// `run start` that could execute it -- and a one-member blueprint standing in for
// a role would have to invent the member name, which is the one thing a role must
// leave open.
//
// So this is a JSON record beside toolstore's, and roles/<name>.json is a file a
// human can read without knowing the blueprint schema.
//
// # Applied when an agent is created, never consulted at run time
//
// `agent create --role reviewer` copies this record's fields into the agent's
// rendered YAML. The rendered file records the outcome; it carries no reference
// back here.
//
// That is the load-bearing decision in this package. `run start` freezes
// blueprint.snapshot.yaml so that a run is judged by rules which cannot change
// underneath it, and a `role:` meaning "look up roles/reviewer.json when the run
// starts" would put part of those rules outside the snapshot: redefining a role
// would then silently change every agent that named it, including agents somebody
// reviewed and approved months earlier. Copying makes redefinition safe by making
// it inert -- a role reaches the agents created after it and no others.
//
// The second reason is that `role:` already means something. kernel.Decide picks
// the steer target by Role == "coordinator" and builds a member's Identity as
// "name (role)", and the blueprints in this tree write roles that were never
// defined anywhere. A free-form string cannot become a reference without changing
// what those files mean.
//
// # A role grants nothing by itself
//
// Defining a role creates no agent, touches no existing one, and widens nobody's
// tools. It is a default for a flag the user did not type: `agent create --tools
// read` after `role define auditor --tools bash` grants read, because an explicit
// flag wins over a file written last week.
//
// # One file per role, in the working directory
//
// roles/<name>.json, for the reasons trigstore, modelstore and agentstore give:
// defining one role rewrites one file, so a crash cannot lose a role the command
// never mentioned; and the store sits beside runs/ rather than in $HOME, so a
// role defined for one repository cannot quietly widen an agent's reach in the
// next one.
