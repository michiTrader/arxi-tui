// Package model decides what a provider and a model ARE, and nothing about
// where they are stored.
//
// It exists as its own package for the reason stated in every other pure
// package in this tree: `internal/modelstore` reads and writes the disk, and
// this one is forbidden by internal/arch_test.go from importing os, net/http or
// time. That separation is not tidiness. The rule that decides whether a model
// may be used — it must exist, be unambiguous and be enabled — is the rule the
// live executor will consult before spending money, and a rule that can only be
// exercised by first creating a directory is a rule nobody tests at the edges.
//
// # Why this package comes before the executor
//
// `arxi run start` refuses a non-simulated run today because there is no
// LLM-backed Executor. Writing one needs three things that do not exist yet: an
// endpoint, a credential and a model id. docs/design §20.1 puts them in exactly
// that position — `provider add`, `model list`, `model enable` are the first
// three commands a new user types, before the first run. So this is the step in
// order, not a detour around the executor.
//
// # The key is never here
//
// A Provider stores the NAME of an environment variable, never a key. That is a
// decision from §20.1 ("`provider add` takes `--api-key-env`, the *name of a
// variable*, not the key") and it is enforced rather than documented: see
// validateKeyEnv, which refuses a value that looks like a secret. A key that
// reaches this struct reaches a JSON file in the repository, and from there a
// commit.
