// This is the gate the live executor consults before spending money, and each

//
//   - Not found: a typo. Failing here costs a message; proceeding would send a
//     request that the provider bills for the tokens it read before rejecting
//     the model name.
//   - Ambiguous: two providers offer the id. Picking one — say, the first
//     alphabetically — would route the run to whichever provider happened to
//     sort first, so adding a provider months later silently reroutes every
//     existing agent to a different model at a different price.
//   - Disabled: the operator turned it off. §20.11 lists `model disable` as an
//     operator decision precisely so it can withhold an expensive model, and a
//     resolver that ignored the flag would make the command decorative.
