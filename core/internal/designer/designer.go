// Package designer is the interactive blueprint designer, with no terminal in it.
//
// The shape is the kernel's, deliberately. Update(Model, Input) -> (Model,
// []Command) is Decide(State, Event, Config) -> (State, []Effect) with
// keystrokes where the events go, and Render is a pure function from a model and
// a window size to the frame that should be on screen. cmd/arxi owns raw mode,
// the escape sequences, the real cursor and the file that gets written.
//
// The reason is the reason the kernel is pure, not a taste for symmetry. A
// designer written the obvious way -- a loop that reads a byte, prints a line
// and calls the store -- can only be exercised by driving a terminal, so the
// cases that actually break it are the cases that never get a test: what the
// screen shows when the store holds forty agents and the window is twenty rows,
// what happens when the name you typed is already on disk, what `esc` means on
// the first screen as opposed to the fourth, whether the frame is still correct
// after a refusal. Here every one of those is a sequence of keys folded into a
// model and one string to assert on.
//
// What the designer is FOR is the other half, and it is worth stating because
// `blueprint create` already composes a team out of stored agents. That verb
// takes the names on the command line, which means two things: you have to know
// them before you start, and every refusal arrives after you have finished
// typing. `--members platform` fails because platform is itself a team; a second
// attempt fails because two of the agents you named carry the same member name;
// a third fails on a `stages:` line in a file you did not write. Each of those is
// a correct refusal delivered at the worst possible moment.
//
// The designer asks the same questions with the store's own answers in front of
// you, and refuses while you are still choosing. A team is listed and marked
// unpickable with the count and the names to use instead. A duplicate member
// name is refused against the file you already picked, by name. The stage
// cross-check runs on the review screen against agentstore.Team.Validate -- the
// same function the writer runs -- so nothing can be confirmed here and refused
// afterwards.
//
// It writes through agentstore.CreateTeam and nothing else. There is no second
// writer, no new file format and no new noun: the designer's output is a
// `blueprint create` whose arguments you did not have to know.
