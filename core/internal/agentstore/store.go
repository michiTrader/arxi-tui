// Package agentstore keeps an agent on disk as a blueprint with one member, and
// a team as the same kind of file with several.
//
// # Why an agent is a blueprint and not a record of its own
//
// `arxi agent create reviewer --model claude-sonnet-4-6 --tools read,grep`
// (§20.1) could have written a small JSON record the way internal/toolstore
// does, and that was the first plan. It is the wrong one, because "an agent" and
// "a member of a blueprint" are the same noun: both carry a name, a role, a
// model, a tool grant and the advisory trait, and there is nothing an agent can
// declare that a member cannot. A second record type would need a second
// loader, a second validator and a second answer to every question the
// blueprint schema already answers, and the two would drift the first time a
// member field is added. That is not hypothetical: `model` was added to
// kernel.MemberConfig after the fact, and its comment there says `agent create
// --model` and `agent show` are promises already made.
//
// Rendering a one-member blueprint instead buys four properties:
//
//   - Create validates through blueprint.Load, so this store cannot write a
//     file that `arxi blueprint validate agents/<name>.yaml` would reject.
//   - `agent show` renders the same resolved config `run start` executes, so it
//     prints what will run rather than a parallel description of it.
//   - `run start reviewer` and `run start ./reviewer.yaml` load the same bytes,
//     so the frozen snapshot and its SHA are identical either way.
//   - `blueprint create` composes agents already in this directory into a team
//     in the same directory, with no migration and no conversion, and
//     `blueprint install` will land there too.
//
// # Why a team is the same file with more members
//
// `arxi blueprint create feature-team --members backend,frontend,security`
// (§20.4) writes agents/feature-team.yaml, and the only difference from the file
// `agent create` writes is the length of the member list. That is the whole
// reason Team below renders through the same quoting, the same atomic publish and
// the same load-before-return check as Record: the two are not two formats.
//
// The members are COPIED, not referenced. A `members: [backend]` pointing at
// agents/backend.yaml would be shorter and is wrong, because `run start` freezes
// the blueprint into runs/<id>/blueprint.snapshot.yaml (ADR-0001/0002) and a
// reference would leave the rules of the run outside the snapshot: editing
// agents/backend.yaml afterwards would silently change what an already-recorded
// run means, and the SHA that is supposed to identify the whole configuration
// would not cover most of it.
//
// The copy is what makes the refusals in Team.Validate necessary rather than
// fussy -- a member copied out of a file can carry a `stages` list naming stages
// this team does not declare, and kernel.participates would then return false for
// that member in every stage, forever.
//
// # Why the rendered file declares one stage
//
// Because without one it cannot run, and it took a hand-run to notice.
//
// applyRunStarted activates the members of the stage it enters, and returns nil
// when the config declares none. A stageless one-member file therefore starts,
// enters nothing, spawns no turn, and records run.quiescent -- "nobody is
// working and nobody can start" -- as the second event, after zero turns and
// zero dollars. Every check passed it: blueprint.Load accepted it, `arxi
// blueprint validate` accepted it, `agent show` printed it, and `agent create`
// finished by printing `run it:` under it. The only symptom was a run that did
// nothing, which is the one failure this store exists to prevent.
//
// The earlier argument against a stage was that advance rules would then be
// evaluated against a stage the author never wrote. They are, and for one member
// `advance_when: all` advances exactly when that member submits -- the only rule
// a lone member can have. `all` rather than the identical-for-one `any` because
// this file is meant to be grown: the moment a second member is added by hand,
// `any` would advance on whichever finished first and ship half the work, where
// `all` waits. The default that survives being grown is the one to write down.
//
// internal/kernel's TestRunStartedWithoutStagesEntersNothing still pins the
// stageless arm of the reducer. What changed is that no stored agent takes it.
//
// # Where the directory lives, and why one file each
//
// In the working directory, beside runs/, policies/, triggers/ and providers/,
// for the reason internal/toolstore argues at greater length: an agent created
// once for a throwaway experiment must not still exist, with its tool grant, in
// every other repository on the machine afterwards.
//
// One file per agent rather than one index, also following toolstore: a crash
// mid-write cannot lose the definition of an agent the command never mentioned,
// and agents/backend.yaml is a path a human can open, diff and commit.
