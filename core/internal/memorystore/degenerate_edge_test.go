// TestASelfReferentialRetireCannotFreezeARecord pins an emergent safety property,
// not a guard in the code: a version cannot name its own ID in Retires, so the
// degenerate "a version retires itself" that would leave a record with zero heads
// is unconstructable rather than merely unhandled.
//
// The reason is content addressing. A version ID is the digest of an identity
// that includes Retires (ADR-0032) and Supersedes, so the moment a version lists
// a target its own ID shifts, and it can never come out equal to a target it
// already contains. An attempt to build a self-retire therefore names a version
// that is not in the store, and ADR-0033 ignores an edge whose target is not the
// declaring record's own -- here it is no record's -- so the writer stays a
// healthy head.
//
// This test exists because that safety is one deleted struct field away from
// gone. If Retires (or Supersedes) were dropped from `identity`, the ID would no
// longer cover it, a self-retire would become constructable, and the record would
// be frozen with zero heads, unreadable and invisible to Forks -- the ADR-0029
// pathology through a new door. Removing the field from `identity` makes this
// test fail, which is the point: it is why no runtime guard against a self-edge
// is needed.
