	Scopes []Scope
	// Clearance is the highest sensitivity the caller may receive. A record
	// whose level outranks it is withheld in the authorization step, before
	// ranking, on the same reasoning ADR-0027 gives for scope. Empty is the
	// public floor: a caller that names no clearance receives only material that
	// needs none, which is the fail-closed default rather than a wildcard.
	Clearance Sensitivity
	// Purposes is the set of uses the caller is authorized to serve. A record is
	// visible only if its purpose is in this set (ADR-0043). Empty authorizes
	// nothing -- a caller that names no purpose is authorized for no purpose --
	// which is the fail-closed default and the honest one for an unranked
	// dimension: purpose has no floor member to fall back to, so this mirrors the
	// scope rule (an empty scope set authorizes no holder) rather than the
	// clearance rule (an empty clearance is the public floor).
	Purposes []Purpose
	// EvidenceClasses is the set of evidence kinds the caller will act on. A record
	// is visible only if its class is in this set (ADR-0044). Empty authorizes
	// nothing, the same fail-closed floor as the purpose set and for the same
	// reason: evidence class is unranked, so there is no floor member to fall back
	// to, and a caller that names no class accepts no evidence rather than all of
	// it. This mirrors the scope and purpose rules, not the clearance floor.
	EvidenceClasses []EvidenceClass
	// AsOf is the instant in valid time the caller is asking about, and it is the one
	// clock value this query carries -- supplied by the caller, never read by the
	// store (ADR-0047). A record is visible only if its validity interval contains
	// this instant, checked in the same pre-ranking step as scope, clearance, purpose
	// and evidence class: a fact whose window ended before the as-of is withheld
	// exactly as one outside the caller's scope is, because presenting it would assert
	// as current something true only in the past. Empty is the timeless floor, not a
	// wildcard: a caller that names no as-of receives only records that declared no
	// validity window, never a bounded record it gave no instant to evaluate --
	// fail-closed, and the reason it parallels the clearance floor rather than the
	// purpose empty-set. There is no interval on the query and no "valid between"
	// range, because a caller asks about one moment; a caller interested in a span
	// asks about the moments in it.
	AsOf Instant
	// There is deliberately no confidence field here. Confidence ranks the
	// authorized set, it does not authorize (ADR-0045), so there is nothing for a
	// query to match against: a caller does not ask for "records of at least
	// medium confidence" the way it names the scopes, purposes and classes it is
	// authorized for. A record of any confidence the caller is otherwise entitled
	// to is returned; confidence only decides the order. Adding a query-side
	// confidence floor here would turn a ranking dimension into an authorization
	// one and withhold material the caller may see merely because the writer was
	// unsure -- the exact confusion this dimension is the worked example against.
	//
	// There is likewise no retention field here, and for a stronger version of
	// the same reason (ADR-0046). Confidence at least changes the order of the
	// result; retention does not touch retrieval at all -- it decides only
	// whether a lifecycle sweep may expire a record, never whether a caller may
	// see it or where it ranks. A query-side retention filter would withhold a
	// record the caller is entitled to merely because it is expirable, conflating
	// "may be swept" with "may not be read". A caller that wants only durable
	// records is asking a lifecycle question the sweep answers, not a retrieval
	// one this query answers.
	// Limit caps the returned records. Zero means no cap.

// the scopes it holds; expanding a principal into the scopes it contains is the
