// Beside runs/ rather than in $HOME: a store in $HOME would let memory written
// while working in one repository influence an agent's answers in the next one,
// silently. Cross-run recall is the feature; cross-repository recall is a
// leakage the user never asked for. trigstore/store.go argues the same trade-off
// for triggers; the other stores state the location without the reasoning, so
// the project-local property is held across the whole family by a derived test
// (internal/store_locality_test.go) rather than trusted store by store — see
// ADR-0035 for why the guarantee is pinned rather than restated in each comment.

//
// A distinct suffix rather than a subdirectory so that Versions' existing
// filter — "a file is a version if it ends in .json" — keeps claims out of the

// guarantee is that a receipt naming version 2 describes what version 2 said —
// which is false the moment version 2's file can be overwritten. Append-only
// files also mean a crash mid-write loses at most the version being written,
// never a version somebody already received a receipt for.
//
// The cost is that reading a record means reading its versions and walking the
// supersession chain. That is the right trade at this size and the honest one:

// releaseClaimAfterFailedWrite undoes a claim whose version was never written.
//
// # Why a failed write must not keep its exclusion
//
// The claim is taken first so that a refused supersession leaves nothing
// behind, and ADR-0028 justified preferring it to a lock on the grounds that it
// "needs no release because it is the durable record of a fact that does not
// expire: that predecessor now has a successor". A probe of that claim found
// the gap in the sentence. When the write that the claim was taken for fails,
// the fact it records never became true -- no successor exists -- and the claim
// that outlives it is precisely the stale lock the ADR rejected locking to
// avoid, reintroduced under another name.
//
// The consequence was measured, not supposed. An ordinary I/O failure on the
// version write -- no crash, no tampering, no hostile replica -- left a claim
// naming a version that does not exist. `Correct` and `Delete` both resolve a
// tip and then supersede it, so both were refused from then on, permanently,
// for a record whose supersession chain was completely healthy and whose
// retrieval kept serving the pre-correction body as current. Worse, the refusal
// told the user the predecessor "is already superseded by" a version ID that is
// on no disk anywhere, and no verb in the package could see the claim at all:
// Versions, Retrieve and Forks were all blind to it, because a fork is two
// versions and this is zero.
//
// Releasing it is safe here and only here. O_EXCL means the creator of a claim
// is its exclusive holder, so a claim this call created is one no other writer
// can be acting on; `mine` carries that distinction, and a claim found already
// held is never released, because it belongs to somebody else's write.
//
// A crash between the claim and the write still strands one -- no in-process
// rollback can cover a process that stops existing -- and that residue is now
// visible through Claims and resolvable through ReleaseClaim rather than being
// permanent and invisible.

// two current versions, and the store is unreadable. That is ADR-0006's race
// exactly — two writers modifying state the other one read — and that ADR
// settled this project's answer as compare-and-swap against a version token
// rather than a lock. `Supersedes` is that token: it names one immutable
// version of one record.
//
// A probe raced two concurrent `Correct` calls and bricked the store in three
// runs out of five, with both calls returning nil. Nothing in the suite saw it,
// because the fork guard built its fork from two deliberate `Put` calls and
// asserted only that retrieval then failed — which cannot tell a contained
// refusal from a catastrophic one.
//
// O_EXCL makes the exclusion a property of the filesystem rather than a check
// this code must remember to perform under concurrency, which is the same
// mechanism and the same argument `Put` already uses to refuse overwriting a
// version file. It needs no release, and that is why it is preferred to a lock:
// a lock must be released, so a crash between claim and write strands one, and
// every rule for breaking a stale lock is a guess about whether the holder is
// alive. This file records a fact that does not expire — that predecessor now
// has a successor.
//
// The claim is never read by retrieval. `tips` still derives the current
// version by walking supersession, so this is a write-side exclusion and not a
// second source of truth: a claim file that retrieval trusted would be the
// `current` pointer ADR-0027 rejected, and it could disagree with the chain.

// tips reduces a set of versions to the current version of each healthy record,

// reason the package comment gives: a flag is a cache, and a cache that
// disagrees with the chain would let a superseded version be presented while the
// correction sat on disk — the exact failure the exit evidence names.
//
// # The invariant is one current version per record, not one successor per predecessor
//
// A record is forked when it has more than one current version, and that is the
// whole test — regardless of how the second one arose. ADR-0028 detected the
// case it had seen, two versions superseding the same predecessor, by counting
// successors per predecessor. A probe found the case it had not: two *root*
// versions of one record, each with an empty `Supersedes`, share no predecessor,
// so the successor count never rose above one and both were reported current.
// Two `Approve` calls for the same record with different bodies, or an `Approve`
// of a record that already had a `Propose`, produced two live versions that
// Retrieve returned together and `tip` chose between silently — the silent loss
// this store exists to prevent, reached through the gap in the fork test rather
// than through a race the claim mechanism covers.
//
// So the detection is phrased against the invariant directly: group the current
// versions by record, and any record holding two or more is forked. This
// subsumes the multi-successor case — two successors of one predecessor are both
// current — and catches the multi-root case the successor count could not see.
//
// # A fork is contained to its own record, not raised for the whole store
//
// Refused rather than resolved by a tiebreak (ADR-0027): every available
// tiebreak — file order, digest order, mtime — would pick a winner
// deterministically while having no relationship to which version the user
// meant. Contained per record rather than for the whole store (ADR-0028): the
// two return values let a caller refuse the one record without refusing the
// store, and name which record is affected instead of leaking version IDs across
// a scope boundary in an error string. Resolving it is an operator act (ADR-0032)
