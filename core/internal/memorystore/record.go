// Importing the constants is the decision. A parallel enumeration here would be
// the defect ADR-0023 was written about, one layer up: two lists of authority
// kinds drift, and the drift shows up as a record this store considers approved
// and the preparer refuses — or worse, the reverse. contextprep is the package
// that enforces presentability at the barrier, so it owns the vocabulary and
// this store spends it.

// Record is one immutable version of one governed memory record.
//
// # Versions are values, not mutations
//
// ADR-0021 decided a receipt names the record version it presented, so that a
// correction has something to supersede. That is only true if a version is
// immutable once written: if editing a record rewrote its body in place, a
// receipt naming version 2 would describe whatever version 2 says *now*, and
// correction propagation — the thing Phase 7's exit evidence requires — would be
// unverifiable against it. So `Correct` appends a new version and supersedes the
// old one; nothing here is ever edited.
//
// # Provenance is recorded, never inferred
//
// Phase 7 opens with a containment rule: model material "may propose candidates
// but cannot create active memory". `Kind` is how that is represented, and it is
// set by the caller that has the authority to know — a user approval, an
// operator import, or a model proposal — never derived from the content. Content
// cannot be evidence of its own provenance, which is the whole argument of
// ADR-0020: memory is data, and data does not get to declare its own authority.

	// version IDs and a receipt is portable between them.
	VersionID string `json:"version_id"`
	// Supersedes names the version this one corrects, empty for a first
	// version. It makes the correction chain walkable from either end, which
	// is what lets retrieval prove it returned a tip rather than trusting a
	// flag on the record.
	Supersedes string `json:"supersedes,omitempty"`
	// Retires names the other current versions this one supersedes at once, and
	// it exists for exactly one operation: resolving a fork. Supersession is
	// one-parent by design, and a one-parent append can never reduce a record's
	// current-version count -- it turns one head into a non-head and adds a new
	// head, a net change of zero. So no chain of Corrects can bring a forked
	// record back to a single current version, which is why Resolve names the
	// losing heads here and tips() treats a retired version as not current.
	// Empty for every write that is not a fork resolution, so it never touches
	// the identity of an ordinary version.
	Retires []string `json:"retires,omitempty"`

	Scope Scope  `json:"scope"`
	Kind  string `json:"kind"`
	// Sensitivity is the classification retrieval authorizes on beside the
	// scope. It is required (ADR-0042): an unclassified record's level is
	// unknown, and treating unknown as public is the fail-open direction. Set
	// once at creation and carried forward by every correction, like the scope,
	// because a correction that dropped it would silently declassify the record.
	Sensitivity Sensitivity `json:"sensitivity"`
	// Purpose is the use the record is approved for, the third dimension
	// retrieval authorizes on beside the scope and the sensitivity. It is
	// required (ADR-0043): an unstated use is unknown, and treating unknown as
	// any purpose would surface the record for every use -- purpose creep by
	// construction. Set once at creation and carried forward by every
	// correction, like the scope and the sensitivity, because a correction that
	// dropped it would silently re-purpose the record.
	Purpose Purpose `json:"purpose"`
	// EvidenceClass is the kind of evidence backing the record, the fourth
	// dimension retrieval authorizes on beside the scope, the sensitivity and the
	// purpose. It is required (ADR-0044): unstated evidence is unknown, and
	// treating unknown as any class would surface an inference wherever an
	// assertion was asked for. Set once at creation and carried forward by every
	// correction, like the other three, because a correction that dropped it would
	// silently reclassify what the record is evidence of.
	EvidenceClass EvidenceClass `json:"evidence_class"`
	// Confidence is how far the writer vouches for the record, the first dimension
	// that feeds ranking rather than authorization (ADR-0045). It is required: an
	// unstated confidence is no assessment, and defaulting it would launder a
	// missing judgment into a stated one. Set once at creation and carried forward
	// by every correction, like the four authorization dimensions, because a
	// correction that dropped it would silently restate how much to trust the
	// record -- and unlike them it never withholds a record, it only orders it.
	Confidence Confidence `json:"confidence"`
	// Retention is the lifecycle policy the record is kept under, the first
	// dimension that feeds neither authorization nor ranking but expiry
	// (ADR-0046). It is required: an unstated retention is no lifecycle decision,
	// and defaulting it would either hoard a record meant to be transient or expire
	// one meant to be kept. Set once at creation and carried forward by every
	// correction, like the five dimensions above, because a correction that dropped
	// it would silently re-tier the record -- and unlike the authorization
	// dimensions it never withholds a record and unlike confidence it never orders
	// one; it only decides whether an automated sweep may expire it.
	Retention Retention `json:"retention"`
	// Validity is the interval in valid time during which the record's assertion is
	// true in the modeled world, the fifth and last dimension retrieval authorizes on
	// (ADR-0047). It is the store's second time axis: the version chain records
	// transaction time -- when the store came to believe a thing -- and this records
	// when the thing is true, which the chain cannot. Retrieval withholds a record
	// whose interval does not contain the query's as-of instant, in the same
	// pre-ranking step as scope, clearance, purpose and evidence class. Both bounds
	// are optional -- an empty bound is the honest "no known start/end" rather than an
	// unknown to refuse -- and it is carried forward by every correction like the
	// dimensions above, because a correction that dropped it would silently re-date
	// when the fact was true.

	Body     string   `json:"body"`

	// Origin records who or what produced this version: an authenticated
	// principal, an import name, or the run that proposed it. The exit
	// evidence requires that "every influence identifies its source", and the
	// scope says which holder the record belongs to, not who wrote it.
	Origin string `json:"origin"`
	// CreatedSeq and CreatedRun bind a version to the execution that produced
	// it when there was one. Empty for user and operator writes, which happen
	// outside any run; a synthetic run ID for those would be indistinguishable
	// downstream from a real one, the same argument ADR-0021 makes for leaving
	// RecordID empty on frozen configuration memory.
	CreatedRun string `json:"created_run,omitempty"`
	CreatedSeq int64  `json:"created_seq,omitempty"`

	// Deleted marks a tombstone. Deletion is a version like any other, for
	// the reason the phase's exit evidence gives: deletion must propagate
	// "without resurrection", and a record removed by truncating a file can be
	// resurrected by any replica or backup that still holds the old bytes.

	// Retention is part of the identity for the same reason the dimensions above

	// window could be edited in place, a record a receipt named as true through 2026
	// could be silently narrowed to end in 2025, so a retrieval that correctly
