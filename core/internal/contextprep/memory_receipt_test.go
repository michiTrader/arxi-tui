// a RecordID but no VersionID is the realistic failure (a store that knows
// which record it returned but not which revision), and it is the one that
// breaks correction propagation: there is nothing for a correction to
// supersede.

// test invented. ADR-0023 enumerated the kinds and they began failing with
