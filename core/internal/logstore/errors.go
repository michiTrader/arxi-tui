// CASError reports that AppendIfSeq was rejected because the log had moved on.
//
// This is a distinct type, and it carries Actual, for a reason that ADR-0006
// states directly: a client whose compare-and-swap is rejected "has to re-read.
// That is a feature: the new state reaches it before it insists." If this were
// returned as a plain error string, the caller could only tell "the write did
// not happen" and would have to guess whether the right response is to re-read
// and retry or to stop and page a human. Those two responses are opposite: one
// is a normal, expected outcome of optimistic concurrency, the other means the
// disk is gone. Collapsing them is how a broken volume gets retried in a tight
// loop forever.
//
// Actual is the head the log was really at, so the caller can re-read exactly
// the range it is missing without a second round trip.

// obvious: do not retry in a loop, and above all do not delete the lock. Two
// writers on one log produce duplicate `seq`, and a duplicate `seq` is what
// breaks the CAS of ADR-0006 — the failure does not appear at write time, it
// appears weeks later as a run whose history cannot be folded.

// gap, and `Fold` cannot distinguish a gap from an event that never existed. It
// would produce a state that is plausible and wrong, which is precisely the
// outcome ADR-0002 was written to prevent.

// Rejecting instead of overwriting is deliberate. ADR-0002 says the reducer
// returns events with `seq: 0` because it cannot know what global order its
// output will land in. A caller that fills in `seq` believes it controls that
// order, and it does not. Silently overwriting the value would make the write
// succeed while the caller's model of the log stayed wrong, and the divergence
// would only surface later as an event referring to a `seq` that means something
// else. Failing here costs one loud error at the boundary instead.
