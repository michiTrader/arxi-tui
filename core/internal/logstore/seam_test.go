// TestStoreSatisfiesTheExecutorsLogInterface is the seam test between the two
// halves of the executor, which were written in parallel by different authors
// against the same ADRs and never compiled together until now.
//
// It lives in the _test file of this package on purpose. internal/exec must not
// import internal/logstore — TestExecutorDependsOnlyOnTheKernel enforces that,
// so the runner stays testable without a filesystem and storage details cannot
// leak into the run loop. The dependency therefore has to be asserted from this
// side, and only in a test, so no production import is created in either
// direction.
//
// Without this assertion the two packages agree only by coincidence. The
// mismatch would not surface in either package's own test suite; it would
// surface at the wiring site in cmd/arxi, which is the worst place to discover
// that the storage contract and the runner's expectation of it disagree.
