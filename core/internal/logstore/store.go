// components could write the log, or if a half-written batch could survive a
// crash, then `State = fold(Decide, State0, events)` would stop being a
// function of the log, and every guarantee built on top of it (replay,
// `run why`, `--sim` agreeing with `run`) would become a coincidence.

// The kernel must never import this package. The dependency runs one way:
// logstore knows about kernel.Event and kernel.Decide, and the kernel does not

// HOW A BATCH IS ATOMIC. A single write() of the whole buffer is not enough:

// across a crash, so a batch of three events could come back as two whole lines
// plus a torn one. Two of three events surviving is worse than none surviving,
// because the two that survived describe a decision the reducer never
// completed.
//
// So the write is bracketed by an intent marker:
//
//  1. write pendingFileName containing the log's current committed size, fsync
//     it, fsync the directory — now the rollback point is durable;
//  2. write the whole batch, fsync the log;
//  3. remove pendingFileName, fsync the directory — this is the commit point.
//
// Open rolls the log back to the recorded size whenever the marker is present.
// The batch is therefore visible only if step 3 completed, and step 3 happens
// before Append returns. If a crash lands between 2 and 3, a fully written
// batch is rolled back — that is correct, not a loss: Append never returned, so
// no caller ever learned those events existed and nothing downstream depends on
// them.
//
// FSYNC POLICY. Two fsyncs of the log-side data plus two directory fsyncs per
// batch, all before Append returns. The cost is a few disk round trips per
// batch. It is worth paying because of what an event costs to produce here: an
// event usually records an LLM turn that was already billed, so losing an
// acknowledged append does not merely lose data, it makes the log disagree with
// money that was actually spent, and replay then reconstructs a state that
// never happened. Batching is the amortisation: a turn's events are appended

// TORN-WRITE RECOVERY: an unterminated final line is discarded (and physically

// Why discarding the tail is right: a line with no terminating newline was, by
// construction, never acknowledged. Append fsyncs and clears the intent marker
// before returning, so if the tail is torn then Append did not return, so no
// caller was ever told that event exists and no decision was taken on it.
// Truncating restores the log to the last state anybody could have observed.
//
// Why refusing to open instead would be worse: a torn tail is what a routine
// SIGKILL, OOM or power loss produces. Making that a fatal condition turns
// every crash into an outage that needs manual repair, and the only repair
// available is hand-editing the log — a far more dangerous operation, performed
// under time pressure, on the one file in the system that has no backup by
// design. The failure mode of refusing is "operators learn to edit the log";
// the failure mode of discarding is "an event nobody saw is gone". The second
// is strictly smaller.
//
// Why the same argument does NOT extend to damage in the middle: a bad line
// before the end cannot be un-acknowledged, and skipping it leaves a gap. Fold
// cannot tell a gap from an event that never existed, so it would return a
// state that is plausible and wrong — exactly what ADR-0002 was written to
// prevent. There is no safe automatic recovery there, so it refuses loudly.
//
// The physical truncation matters as much as the detection: leaving the partial
// bytes in place would make the next Append concatenate onto them and produce
// one merged, permanently unparseable line — turning a recoverable tail into
