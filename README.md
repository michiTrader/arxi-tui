# arxi tui

The interface is a document. The running instance rewrites it live — you can
too, from inside it.

A terminal agent interface whose entire chrome (rows, panels, overlays,
animations, menus, the input bar itself) is a **scene document** addressed by
node id and edited through commands, patches, or the agent acting on your
word. The factory look is written with the same format you have; nothing the
interface can do is closed to you. The range is real: from two nodes
(type and answer, nothing else) to a full dashboard of panels, widgets and
plugins — and you can install a plugin, or a whole interface someone else
published, by handing arxi a link.

- `AGENTS.md` — how this repo is worked on (English-only, comment/test/commit
  policy, invariants).
- `docs/PLAN.md` — the plan of record: the spectrum, the decisions, the
  phases, the install rule.
- `docs/SCENES.md` — the golden scenes and the 23 settled format decisions.
- `docs/LESSONS.md` — the bugs and hard rules already paid for by arxi-sim
  and the arxi core, with sources. Do not re-derive them.
- `docs/BINDS.md` — the bind vocabulary: every field the host exposes to scenes.

## Status

**Phase 0 — Scene engine:** Complete and running.

- ✅ Scene document parser and validator (`internal/scene`)
- ✅ Fold over log events (`internal/fold`)
- ✅ Render engine with all base nodes: stack, row, box, text, markdown, input,
  overlay, list, spinner, marquee, rule (`internal/engine`)
- ✅ Terminal backend with input decoder, alternate buffer, cursor control (`internal/term`)
- ✅ Mock driver for Phase 0 dev, serve driver for Phase 0.5 (`internal/driver`)
- ✅ Event loop with double Ctrl-C escape gesture (`cmd/arxi-tui/main.go`)
- ✅ Golden scenes: RAW, SOBRIA, MAXIMUM running and tested
- ✅ Bootstrap binds: `chat.history`, `user.input`, `agent.working`, `thinking.text`,
  `usage.delta`, `slash.active`, `slash.matches`, `agent.mode`, `model.name`
- ✅ Full test suite passing (9 packages)

**Phase 1 — Tokens and themes:** Complete.

- ✅ Token format and JSON schema (`internal/theme/theme.go`)
- ✅ Token resolver with open definition (no enum)
- ✅ Factory SOBRIA theme with OSC 11 background detection
- ✅ Token wire-up in render pipeline (`engine.Cell.Style`)
- ✅ Styled golden fixtures: `RAW.styled`, `SOARIA.styled`, `MAXIMUM.styled`
- ✅ Theme validation (scenes reference existing tokens)

**Phase 1.5 — The SCENES ↔ BINDS audit:** Complete.

- ✅ `internal/scene/binds_audit_test.go` parses `docs/BINDS.md` and holds the
  validator's runtime inventory to the signed document, in both directions
- ✅ All three pinned scenes audited (MAXIMUM was previously unchecked)
- ✅ An unexercised signed bind is a logged warning, per `AGENTS.md`
- ✅ Inventory drift repaired: 4 unsigned binds removed, 18 signed-but-rejected
  binds restored, `agent.todos` signed in §4.1

**Phase 1.6 — The address on every refusal:** Complete.

- ✅ `internal/scene/loc.go` maps a byte offset to `file:line:col`, with the
  column counted in runes (the shipped scenes are full of `Δ`, `┃` and
  box-drawing glyphs, so a byte column points mid-character)
- ✅ Every refusal in `internal/scene` is a `*scene.Error` carrying its
  address — unsigned binds and `when` conditions point at the offending node
  (BINDS.md §4.5), and JSON syntax/type errors keep the offset the standard
  library had already computed
- ✅ Undefined token references carry `file:line` too (LESSONS.md's rule, with
  arxi-sim's polarity inverted: the reference is checked, not the inventory)
- ✅ Invariant 3's boot notice reaches the screen: `loadScene` returns the
  addressed reason and the host publishes it on `host.scene.error`, in both
  the tty and the piped render path. It used to fall back silently.
- ✅ A structural guard (`TestEveryRefusalInThisPackageIsAddressed`) covers
  both parse entry points, so a later rule returning a bare `fmt.Errorf`
  fails the suite instead of quietly reopening the gap

**Phase 2 (in progress) — Mutation from inside.** The gate lands before the
feature, as `PLAN.md` requires:

- ✅ `docs/EVAL.md` — the corpus contract: case shape, scoring, and why the
  corpus is data rather than code
- ✅ `internal/eval` + `testdata/eval/` — the corpus loader and its first three
  cases. Every expected refusal is replayed against the real validator on each
  `go test`, so a case cannot claim a refusal the engine does not produce —
  which already caught an invented one (see EVAL.md).
- ⬜ The model runner (converged / turns-to-convergence)
- ⬜ `/ui` commands and agent-driven patches, with the change-diff view

## Build

Requires Go 1.25.

```bash
go build -o arxi-tui ./cmd/arxi-tui
go vet ./... && gofmt -l .
go test -count=1 ./...
UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 go test ./internal/...   # regenerate golden fixtures
```

## Run

```bash
# With mock driver (Phase 0 dev, no arxi binary needed)
./arxi-tui

# With arxi serve subprocess (Phase 0.5, requires arxi binary)
ARXI_BIN=/path/to/arxi ./arxi-tui
```

The default scene is `testdata/SOARIA.json` (the sobria look). If it fails to
load, the interface falls back to the factory RAW scene (two nodes: transcript
and input, nothing else).
